            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE deſign of the following Addreſs is to perſwade to the Re-uniting of a divided Church. And the unity of the Church is that which our Lord and Saviour earneſtly, and with reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Petitions prayed for to his Father, and which his Apoſtles after him did with the moſt pathetical expreſſions they could well take unto themſelves, perſwade the Chriſtians to maintain. By which we may perceive, That the ſucceſs of Chriſts deſign to be carried on by the Goſpel, does very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion; which was the reaſon why the Heart of Chriſt, and of his Apoſtles, were ſo much ſet upon it. And if ſo; Then Diviſions, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
<pb facs="tcp:51946:3"/>Factions and Diſaffections in the Church, and ſeparation of one part of it from another, muſt needs tend to fruſtrate and diſappoint our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in his deſign of Grace, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the Church where theſe take place, of the benefit and comfort in great part, which he intended them in recommending the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to them: And then it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low alſo, That thoſe who are moſt of the mind, ſpirit and temper of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Apoſtles, are and will be moſt tender, leſt they ſhould make any breach in the Church, or diſturb the Peace of it; and moſt careful to do what in them lies to repair breaches when made: But contrariwiſe, that thoſe who are moſt venturous in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king breaches upon pretences that will not abide an impartial tryal, and leaſt careful to cloſe up thoſe which are made, are to that degree that they are ſo, devoid of a Chriſt-like frame of mind and temper of ſpirit. All which looks moſt unpleaſantly upon ſo many as will not do all that they can do to
<pb facs="tcp:51946:3"/>prevent the farther growth of Schiſm, and to heal the Churches wounds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made by it.</p>
            <p>Conſidering all which, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable ſtate and condition of the Church in this Nation by reaſon of Schiſm, and what men ſuffer and are like to ſuffer thereby in their religious intereſt; I cannot imagine wherein, or by what, good men can better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themſelves to Chriſt in any one thing, and more anſwer the Joy of his heart, nor better ſerve their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than by endeavouring heartily according to the capacity they are in, and the opportunity they have, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the re-uniting of the divided parts of the Church of God in this Nation. And if by endeavours of this nature, any think I have acted more than comes to my ſhare in this Addreſs or otherwiſe; it hath been out of the abundance of my affection to ſo good and neceſſary a work, which will eaſily obtain pardon from thoſe that are for peace. I cannot ſay, but that many attempts of this Nature have
<pb facs="tcp:51946:4"/>been made by others, and endeavours uſed to this end. But the reaſon why ſo little comes of it, is, becauſe thoſe who are the Aggreſſors, or many of them, would needs make themſelves the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and <hi>Standard</hi> of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. But how unreaſonable it is to expect that an union ſhould be brought to paſs upon ſuch terms, or to think it fit that our breaches ſhould lie open till it can, is eaſie to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. For when will all Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans think you be perſwaded to turn Anabaptiſts or Independents, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents to turn Anabaptiſts, or Anabaptiſts to turn Independents, or both to turn Presbyterians? Or if they ſhould, when will thoſe of the way of the Church of <hi>England</hi> fall in with them? So that there ſeems a neceſſity of one of theſe two things; either for all the ſubdivided parts of the Agreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors to Re-unite themſelves again to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from which they unduly rent themſelves: Or elſe to perpetuate our various Schiſms un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we have made our ſelves thereby a
<pb facs="tcp:51946:4"/>prey to the common Adverſary. And whoever are of the mind to put things on this iſſue, and to run that hazard rather than to come to ſuch terms of accommodation as are not ſinful, though otherwiſe not altogether ſuch as they could wiſh, will certainly ſhew themſelves to be perſons of but <hi>private</hi> ſelfiſh ſpirits, regarding more their own perſonal ſatisfaction and private conveniency, than the <hi>publick</hi> benefit of the Church in general: a temper very unworthy a Chriſtian, and far from a laying down the life for the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. It was the <hi>true</hi> Mother who was for yielding to her Competitrix, rather than the Child ſhould be <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi> Beſides, by continuing a Schiſm upon ſuch terms which will not amount to any ſufficient or juſt cauſe, they make themſelves accountable for all the dreadful effects of it.</p>
            <p>Since then there is no probability that the Aggreſſors in their ſubdiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will ever ſettle or unite upon any one of their narrow foundations, it will I doubt not be much more becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:51946:5"/>them as Chriſtians, for them all to <hi>reconcile</hi> themſelves to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> rather than to perpetuate ſuch a complex Schiſm as we ſee hath caſt both Church and Nation into a Convulſion, and threatens its final ruin. Do you or can you think that there is at this day, after all tryals made, any men upon Earth better Chriſtians than many of thoſe who have been bred in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſince the Reformation from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and who have lived and died in her Communion? I can hardly think that any ſober, intelligent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will venture to ſay there is. And if not, what is the matter then if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the being very good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans be your deſign, why (rather than to make a Schiſm) that will not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie you for the attaining to it, which hath been ſo ſucceſsful for the effecting this end in ſo many other worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as have left us an example of holy living, worthy our imitation? Why the matter as I apprehend it, ſtands thus: Thoſe whoſe minds had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced
<pb facs="tcp:51946:5"/>and affected with the different principles of the old Non Conformiſts, Browniſts, and Anabaptiſts, before our late unhappy Civil Wars brake out, took the opportunity which it gave them, to begin a work of reformation in this Nation, as they Notioned it to be. And although they all ſtill agreed with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in doctrines of faith and a holy life, and in thoſe doctrines wherein it oppoſeth the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> yea and in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Divine worſhip alſo: Yet they all oppoſed the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the external form of worſhip, and in her order and Government. But when they had done ſo, they could not agree among themſelves what form of worſhip and Government, in oppoſition to all other, is indeed of Divine Right, but therein ſharply oppoſed one another. So that this ſo called Reformation, produced more diviſions and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and multiplied more, and more monſtrous Sects, than ever there were in the Nation before. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſad experience of all which, and
<pb facs="tcp:51946:6"/>notwithſtanding the means uſed by the Higher Powers to reduce them; yet it ſeems theſe ſeveral divided parts have thought themſelves concerned upon one account or other, ſtill to carry on their eſteemed Reformation in their ſeveral different ways, and rather to run the hazard of all the ill conſequences of their diviſion in common from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſubdiviſions among themſelves, than to return to our Parochial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
            <p>Now then, the endeavour of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Addreſs, is to ſhew theſe two things eſpecially. The one is, That both the Principles and practice in many things, wherein this Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion endeavoured by them doth conſiſt, are really corruptions, and things which ought themſelves to be Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The other is, that if any Emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in matters Eccleſiaſtical, ſhall be found convenient for the peace, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſtability of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> as I will not deny but there may, the preſent genius and temper of
<pb facs="tcp:51946:6"/>many of this Nation conſidered (for <hi>Moſes</hi> for the hardneſs of the peoples hearts, by Gods direction put that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the body of the Law, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would not have been nceſſary:) Yet to ſeek this by ſeparation from our Pariſh Churches, and by gathering Churches out of them, and by keeping aſſemblies in oppoſition to them, is no good method of proceeding therein, but ſuch as tends to hurt the Church of God much more than to do it good, and to ſet people back and not to bring them forward in that wherein the heart and ſpirit of true Chriſtianity lies. And for my Juſtification in this undertaking, I have the old Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts ſo far on my ſide, as that, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaith, Such as Mr. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright, Egerton, Hilderſham, Dod, Ameſius, Parker, Bains, Brightman, Ball, Bradſhaw, Paget, Langly, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cols, Hering, and many ſuch, wrote more againſt ſeparation, than the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts did.</hi> And the former writings of the preſent Presbyterians, abound alſo with invectives againſt the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb facs="tcp:51946:7"/>of gathering Churches out of our Pariſh Churches. Yea thoſe who have been chief in the Congregational way, have in their Apologetical Narration told the World, <hi>That all that Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of defilement they conceived cleaved to the worſhip of God in our Pariſh Churches, or of the unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able power of Church Governours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed therein, did never work in any of them any other thought, much leſs opinion, but that multitudes of the Pariſh Congregations, were the true Churches and body of Chriſt, and the Miniſtry thereof a true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</hi> And again: <hi>We have always profeſt</hi> (ſay they) <hi>(and that in theſe times when the Churches of</hi> England <hi>were moſt, either actually over-ſpread with defilements, or in the greateſt danger thereof) that we both did and would hold a Communion with them as the Churches of Chriſt.</hi> I ſhall not offend you by making that improvement of theſe Conceſſions by <hi>reflections,</hi> which the matter is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of. Only I heartily wiſh, That for
<pb facs="tcp:51946:7"/>the honour of our Religion, we may all be careful to do that which is good and commendable, not only in the ſight of God, but alſo in the ſight of men: and that nothing may be done but what we can give ſome competent account of unto men. A thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you have left even ſuch as wiſh you very well, much to ſeek, as not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to reconcile your principles and your practice. What hath been offered by ſome in order to it from the conſideration of the different cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of former and preſent times,
<note place="margin">
                  <p>Doctrine of Schiſm opened and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to gathered Churches.</p>
                  <p>A ſtop to the courſe of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               </note> I muſt needs ſay falls ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhort of it, and hath met with ſuch a return from other ſome, as hath even left it without any ſtrength at all, eſpecially in that which relates to Lay Communion.</p>
            <p>Now the God of love and peace at laſt lead us out of all thoſe diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and confuſions into which our own weakneſs and folly hath betrayed us, into paths of purity, peace, and
<pb facs="tcp:51946:8"/>love, and beſtow upon us all a ſpirit of love, and of a ſound mind, that ſo we may all come to keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW I am upon leaving the World by reaſon of Age; ſome reaſons have prevailed with me to leave behind me for you, a few words, not of bitter Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but of Peace, and to Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſuch only as are agreeable to a <hi>following the Truth in Love.</hi> And
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51946:9"/>in doing ſo, methinks I might promiſe my ſelf, that what ſhall be thus offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will with a like mind be ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and weighed by all ſuch among you as in whom paſſion, prejudice, and partiality, do not prevail more than that <hi>wiſdom which is from above, which is firſt pure, then peaceable and eaſie to be intreated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How unfit ſoever I may in other reſpects be thought for this underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, yet my former experience in your way, and the many ſerious and impartial conſiderations I have had about it, may poſſibly have given me ſo much advantage for it, as may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my preſent undertaking. And beſides, if he that <hi>digged a pit</hi> (Ex. 23.33.) <hi>was to cover it;</hi> no man need to wonder if I concern my ſelf more than many others, by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring what in me lies, to Cure the almoſt Epidemical Diſeaſe of Schiſm in ſome, and to prevent it in others. For however the general prevailing of it ſeems to have worn out that ſenſe of the hainouſneſs of it which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51946:9"/>the Church of God and all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Guides in it anciently had of it, and to have changed its name, and to be now adopted into the number of Virtues, and to be eſteemed an Ornament among too many; yet I aſſure you it is not ſo with me, who have ſeen and obſerved the diſmal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it. And doubtleſs it is not grown any whit the leſs hainous by prevailing ſo much as it hath done, unleſs a thing becomes the leſs evil by how much the more miſchief it does.</p>
               <p>This evil took place preſently after the Reformation from Popery, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a clog to it then, as it hath been ever ſince. And I know nothing ſo like to ſubvert the Reformation, and at laſt to deliver us up again unto a Papal Power, as this Sin of Schiſm.</p>
               <p>Therefore blame me not if you find me endeavouring to awaken you into the ſame ſenſe of it which I my ſelf have. If you will but take your meaſure of what it is like to produce among the whole Proteſtant party in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51946:10"/>the end, if a ſtop be not put to it, by what the diviſions among your ſelves in the greateſt part of your Congregations in this Nation hath brought forth, eſpecially in the Weſt; the proſpect will be ſad enough, and ſuch as one would think ſhould cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in you a great jealouſy touching the practice of ſeparating from other Proteſtant Congregations. I ſhould think it might well cauſe you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether thoſe Sub-diviſions, and ſub-ſeparations among your ſelves, do not befal you as a correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for your firſt dividing from others without a cauſe, and to awaken you to review the grounds on which it hath been done.</p>
               <p>Now to convince you that you have no ſufficient ground to ſeparate upon account of <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> and that you have great cauſe to repent that you have ſo done, is that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs which I chiefly deſign in this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Addreſs, ſo far as it concerns you only.</p>
               <p>You are wont to interpret the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51946:10"/>of Chriſts Commiſſion to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, by what is recorded in point of <hi>fact,</hi> touching who or what manner of perſons were Baptized by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and others in their times: and to conclude that no Infants were au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by that Commiſſion, to be Baptized, ſince as you ſuppoſe the Scripture gives no account that any ſuch were Baptized. But if this way of arguing were good, it would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly make againſt your own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, whether it make any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Infant Baptiſm or no. For then the ſaid Commiſſion of our Saviour would not warrant the baptizing of any ſuch as you baptize, to wit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at age, whoſe Parents were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians when they were born, and who have been educated from their Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in the Chriſtian Religion: for there is not the leaſt hint in Scripture that any ſuch were baptized in the Apoſtles days, nor of any (except Infants) but only ſuch as were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from Judaiſm or Paganiſm, to Chriſtianity, and that preſently
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51946:11"/>after ſuch their Converſion.</p>
               <p>But if you think the lawfulneſs of baptizing ſuch perſons as you baptize, may be deduced by way of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from Chriſts Commiſſion, though there be no inſtances in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the baptizing any ſuch; Then you cannot deny it to be lawful to baptize Infants, if the lawfulneſs of it can be deduced from Chriſts Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to baptize, though there ſhould be no inſtances in Scripture of the baptizing any Infants. By this you ſee that your popular argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Infant Baptiſm, falls foul upon your ſelves and your own practice. The difference then between you and the Paedo-Baptiſts, muſt not be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by examples in point of fact, (though if it ſhould, you would be far more to ſeek than they, as ſhall be ſhewed afterwards) but by the Doctrine of the Scriptures relating to Church-memberſhip and Baptiſm, which we will now come to conſider, and therein proceed gradually.</p>
               <p>When any thing hath been wont to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51946:11"/>be argued from the Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Circumciſion of Infants in Old Teſtament times, in favour of the viſible Church-memberſhip and Baptiſm of Infants now, and in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour alſo of the Nationality of Churches; it hath been ſtill replied and urged by you, that there is this difference between the Church then and now, to wit, that the Church was Conſtituted then by <hi>Natural Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> whereas it is Conſtituted now by <hi>Spiritual Regeneration;</hi> and further, that what was ſufficient to make Church-members then, and to qualifie them for the initiating Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, is not ſo now. And becauſe this is a Corner-ſtone in your build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a foundation principle, upon which both you and the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional men in great part do found your ſeparate Congregations, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be very meet in the firſt place to examine what there is in this pretenſion.</p>
               <p>That which is uſually alledged for it, is <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6, 7, 8. where it's ſaid,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51946:12"/>
                  <hi>They are not all Iſrael which are of Iſrael: neither becauſe they are the ſeed of Abraham, are they all Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: but in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called. That is, they which are the Children of the fleſh, theſe are not the Children of God, but the Children of the promiſe are counted for the ſeed.</hi> However you may have flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd your ſelves from the meer ſound of theſe words to think them a ſtrong foundation for your aforeſaid notion and opinion; yet being more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly looked into, they will be found to ſubvert and utterly overthrow it. For that which theſe words will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly prove, is, that Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip or perſons Relation unto God as his Children, did not, no not in Old Teſtament times, proceed from Natural Generation, or meerly from being <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, according to the fleſh.</p>
               <p>The unbelieving Jews, againſt whoſe pretences the Apoſtle here ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, did indeed hold, that becauſe they were naturally deſcended from
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51946:12"/>
                  <hi>Abraham,</hi> and Circumciſed and kept the Law, that God ſhould be unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and not make good his promiſe, if he ſhould not own them for his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren but caſt them off, as the Apoſtle in his Doctrine it ſeems, aſſerted that he would, if they did not believe but reject the Goſpel of his Son. And that upon which they built this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence was, in that God had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed.</p>
               <p>To take off which pretence of theirs, and to prove that God would act nothing contrary to his promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, though he ſhould reject them for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the Goſpel, he ſhews they were under a great miſtake (juſt as you are now) in thinking they were the Children of God, or of his Church, meerly becauſe they were deſcended from <hi>Abrahams</hi> Loins. For ſaith he, <hi>they are not all Iſrael that are of Iſrael,</hi> which yet they would have been, if ſomewhat elſe had not been requiſite to make them ſo, than
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51946:13"/>their procedure out of his Loins in a courſe of natural Generation. <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe they are the Seed of Abraham, are they all Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> to wit of God, as after he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it when he ſaith, <hi>they that are the Children of the fleſh, theſe are not the Children of God,</hi> Ver. 8.</p>
               <p>But as he ſhewed from what this Relation of Sonſhip unto God did not proceed, ſo he ſhews likewiſe from what it did, by interpreting thoſe words of God to <hi>Abraham, but in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called. That is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they which are the Children of the fleſh, theſe are not the Children of God, but the Children of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe are counted for the ſeed.</hi> Now by Children of the promiſe is meant <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpiritual Seed: for they we ſee are oppoſed to Children of the fleſh: and ſpiritual and carnal are contra-diſtinguiſhed, the one from the other, as Seeds of a different ſpecies or kind. This is ſo plain, as what can be plainer? So that in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time and after, we ſee, thoſe who
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51946:13"/>were Related to God as his Church and Children, were ſo upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their being <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Seed.</p>
               <p>And furthermore, in that any of the Gentiles being proſelyted to the Faith and Religion of <hi>Abraham,</hi> were with their Children to be admitted to the ſame priviledges with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to be numbred with them as they were; it's a plain caſe that their Church-memberſhip or Relation to God as his people, did not then proceed meerly from natural Generation and Relation, they being Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> not according to the fleſh, but according to faith. The ſame may be ſaid of Strangers from among the Gentiles, that were born of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Parents in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Houſe, or bought with his money, they being under his power to inſtruct and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in the true Religion, the Males of them were to be Circumciſed and received into the Church as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Spiritual Seed.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:51946:14"/>
               <p>This being ſo, upon what account little Children were of the Church at that time, we will conſider after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. In the mean time, methinks from what hath been now repreſented to you from the Scriptures, you ſhould not but perceive that the Church was no more conſtituted by natural gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration before the times of the Goſpel, than it is ſince: And that therefore the ſpiritual Conſtitution of the Church under the Goſpel, is no more an argument againſt Infants Church-memberſhip, nor of the Nationality of Churches now, than the like Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Church in Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment times, was an argument againſt them then.</p>
               <p>The next thing I would offer to your conſideration is this, That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that the Conſtitution of the Church in Old Teſtament times, was as well ſpiritual as that in the new, and did as well conſiſt of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Spiritual Seed as the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament Church doth, and that there is no ſuch difference between them
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51946:14"/>as you have imagined: Yet for all that the <hi>whole body</hi> of the Jewiſh peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>Jacobs</hi> Line, ſtood related to God as his Children and peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Before they were incorporated into a Common-wealth, and while they were as yet in <hi>Egypt,</hi> God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſtiled them collectively conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>his Son, Exo.</hi> 4.22, 23. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to the whole body of that people, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>Ye are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Lord your God.</hi> And again, <hi>thou art an holy people unto the Lord thy God, and he hath choſen thee to be a peculiar people unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Deut.</hi> 14.1, 2. Elſewhere they are ſtiled <hi>Saints, Deut.</hi> 33.2, 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.5.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 149.1. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that. unto them <hi>pertained the adoption, Rom.</hi> 9.4. Now theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral appellations, Children of God, holy people, Saints, peculiar people, ſignifie doubtleſs as much when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Old Teſtament Church as when applied to the New, in the Epiſtles to the Churches. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be no difference in the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51946:15"/>general nature of the Conſtitution of the one and of the other. Though there is a difference in the Revelation of the mind of God, and of the way of Salvation to the Church then and now, yet there is no ſuch difference in their Conſtitution, as that the one ſhould be called carnal, and the other ſpiritual: for as thoſe of the Church of the New Teſtament are ſaid to be <hi>Saints by calling, holy brethren, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, a peculiar people,</hi> ſo were thoſe of the old likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Conſidering then that the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament Church was Conſtituted of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Spiritual Seed as well as that of the New; and ſtiled the Children of God, Saints, a holy and peculiar people, as thoſe of the New Teſtament Church alſo are: One of theſe two things muſt of neceſſity follow. Either firſt that the whole body of the people of the Jews under the Old Teſtament, and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Churches of the New, who both came under the aforeſaid deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, were all ſavingly holy, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51946:15"/>no Hypocrites among them: or elſe ſecondly, That ſome people are in Scripture denominated Children of God, a holy People, Saints, a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people and the like, in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects than that of ſaving grace or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal holineſs. And becauſe we have no ground to believe that all thoſe both of the Old Teſtament Church and of the New, to whom the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid appellations are given, were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly ſanctified, ſavingly the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, therefore we muſt of neceſſity conclude, that they were and are ſo called upon ſome other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that is more extrinſecal than that of ſpecial and internal grace.</p>
               <p>And what that ſhould be is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for me to determine, it is enough to my purpoſe that it appears that the forementioned glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations, are in Scripture given to ſome other, than ſuch as are ſavingly ſanctified. But yet that which ſeems to me moſt likely to be it, upon account of which others are ſtiled Saints, the Children of God and the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51946:16"/>like, than thoſe that are ſavingly ſo, is this, to wit Gods chuſing, calling, and ſeparating them from other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World, to be brought near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to him than thoſe others are, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and in learning to profeſs the true Religion. And thus ſuch <hi>are Saints by Calling, Rom.</hi> 1.6, 7. of which I ſhall ſay more afterwards, and of the manner how. But thus there <hi>are many called when but few are choſen,</hi> as our Saviour hath told us again and again. Called, not only by being invited, but really brought to profeſs the true Religion, in the ſincere belief and practice of which, Salvation is to be obtained; when yet they are not the choſen of God in that emphatical ſenſe which is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to thoſe who are inwardly in heart and Soul, ſeparated and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God. Thus all and every one are Gods Sons or Daughters that are called by his name, as every one is that is called to profeſs his name and Religion. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.6, 7. <hi>Bring my Sons from far, and my daughters from
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51946:16"/>the ends of the earth; even every one that is called by my name.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this account, and in this more general reſpect, perſons very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy in point of life and practice, are Gods Sons and Daughters. <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.19. <hi>When the Lord ſaw it, he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred them, becauſe of the provoking of his ſons and of his daughters.</hi> There are many that are Children of Gods Kingdom, that will be caſt out into outer darkneſs, <hi>Math.</hi> 8.12. St. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to all the Churches of <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> ſaith thus unto them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Ye are all the Children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and gives this reaſon of his ſo ſaying: <hi>For as many as have been baptized into Chriſt</hi> (as they all were) <hi>have put on Chriſt, viz.</hi> by profeſſion. And yet many of them were ſuch as made him to write thus of them. <hi>I marvel that ye are ſo ſoon removed from him that called you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the grace of Chriſt, unto another Goſpel,</hi> Chap. 1.6. <hi>I am afraid of you, leſt I have beſtowed on you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in vain, Ch.</hi> 4.11. And again,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51946:17"/>
                  <hi>I ſtand in doubt of you, Ver.</hi> 20. Much more of this nature might be ſaid, and it might be further ſhewed alſo, that the holy Scriptures ſtile ſuch Saints in this more general reſpect, and in a large ſenſe, which were far from appearing to be ſo in the more ſpecial and emphatical ſenſe. Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this nature might be given in Members of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and other Primitive Churches, as well as in the antient Jewiſh Church. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.1. and 8.10, 11. and 15.34. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.20, 21. But I will not multiply words to prove that which appears ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by a few as you ſee.</p>
               <p>But if this be true which I have been proving, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſome in the viſible Church are in Scripture deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated the Children of God, a holy people, Saints, a peculiar people, in other reſpects than ſuch as amount to ſaving grace, or internal holineſs; Then your principle and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of others in the <hi>Congregational way,</hi> cannot be ſound, when you and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51946:17"/>they aſſert, <hi>That none are to be owned as members of the viſible Church, ſo as to be received into Church Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who are not in the Judgment of Charity, ſavingly ſanctified.</hi> For we ſee others than ſuch are in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture account owned as really mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible Church. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the opinion and practice both of you and them in this, can be no other than an <hi>innovation and humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi> and which hath been one principal cauſe of ſo much diviſion in the Church, and of the ſad effects of it, as we have already ſeen. I have nothing to ſay againſt exerciſing as much Charity in your opinion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as you can. But that's no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Charity, nor of truth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to judg thoſe no viſible Church Members for want of ſaving Grace, which yet are ſo in the judgment of God himſelf by the Scriptures. And men ſhould not pretend to be wiſer than their Maker, or think to find out better methods than he hath pitcht upon, for the promoting his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51946:18"/>ends, his own Glory and mans Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But when they do, they lightly do in the total, and at the long run, but fruſtrate and diſappoint thoſe ends, or greatly hinder them, and promote thoſe of a worſe nature. The Judgment of Charity in this matter, is a rule arbitrary and uncertain, and will vary as mens opinions and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions vary, and he ſhall be a good Chriſtian in the charitable judgment of ſome, that ſhall be denied to be ſo in the judgment of others. To ſet up this judgment of Charity for a rule in this matter, is indeed a way like unto which there is none that I can think of ſo prepared and fitted to make parties and Sects in the Church as that is. But to own all to be of the viſible Church who are converted from a falſe to the profeſſion of the true Religion, and the little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſuch, and the ſucceſſors of ſuch in the ſame profeſſion, until they deſert the Church, or are worthily and deſervedly, and in a regular way of proceeding Excommunicated, is
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51946:18"/>to walk by an open, manifeſt, certain, and fixt rule; which had it been duly obſerved, would have preſerved the Church in Unity and Peace, which now is lamentably divided and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by introducing other meaſures. Which brings me to the next thing to be enquired into.</p>
               <p>The next thing then which as I ſay we will enquire into is, how or in what reſpect little Children were members and a part of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Church, and capable of the then initiating Ordinance. And by what hath been before proved, I think we may ſafely conclude, that it was not meerly upon the account of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural deſcent from <hi>Abraham,</hi> or from <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, according to the fleſh. For <hi>Abraham</hi> as he was Father to the Church or Church members as ſuch, it was not in his natural but his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious capacity that he was ſo: it was as he was a believer, that he was and yet is the Father of Believers. And accordingly all that were of the Church, whether young or old, were
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51946:19"/>ſo upon a religious account in one reſpect or other. The Church is not a Natural, Political, or Civil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, but a Religious or Spiritual Community: And therefore all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſo little Children that were of the Church, muſt needs in one reſpect or other have been perſons of a Religious or ſpiritual conſideration. This I think is paſt diſpute. And yet I think that the little Children which were of the Church, could not be looked upon to be in that religious capacity actively, or by any act of their own while but little ones, but were paſſively ſuch.</p>
               <p>This conſidered, I know not upon what better to place the viſible Church-memberſhip of Infants, or to attribute it to, than Gods <hi>electing and calling them to be his people, and their Parents dedicating and devoting them to God and his ſervice.</hi> Firſt, God choſe them to be his people among the reſt. <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.37. <hi>Becauſe he loved thy fathers, therefore he choſe their ſeed after them.</hi> This was the <hi>adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:51946:19"/>of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4. Now Gods thus chuſing them to be his people and declaring that he had choſen them (as he did in promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to be their God) was one degree of ſeparating them from the reſt of the World, and by which they became a holy ſeed, relatively holy I mean.</p>
               <p>But this was not all: but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his people by Gods <hi>calling</hi> them to be ſo as well as by his election and promiſe. The Lord by his Prophet ſtiled the whole body of the people of the Jews, <hi>Iſrael my called, Iſa.</hi> 48.12. By this call of his they were in a further degree ſeparated to God as his people, and differenced from the Heathen Nations that were under no ſuch call. Now God then calleth perſons to be his people, when he placeth them in ſuch circumſtances, or vouchſafeth them ſuch means, as by which they do or will come to take him for their God, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Religion which is of God. Now as to the manner of this call, it is either extraordinary or ordinary.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51946:20"/>As for <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf he ſeems to have been called by God in a way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, by his <hi>appearing and ſpeaking</hi> to him as he did in <hi>Meſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia, Acts</hi> 7.2. But his ſeed and poſterity were called in an ordinary way by being educated from their Childhood in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Religion by their Parents; deriving it from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and ſo ſucceſſively from one Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to another, from Generation to Generation, according to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.5, 6. <hi>The Lord eſtabliſhed a teſtimony in Jacob, and appointed a Law in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, which he commanded our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that they ſhould make them known to their Children: that the generation to come might know them, even the Children which ſhould be born: who ſhould ariſe and declare them to their Children, that they might ſet their hope in God.</hi> And in this way the little Children who were then members of the Church as all confeſs, were <hi>called</hi> to that Church memberſhip, unleſs you can ſuppoſe that any can be Members of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51946:20"/>Church without being called to it. And it was doubtleſs the Election and Call aforeſaid, by which little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were brought into that ſpiritual relation to God and his people, which qualified them for a ſolemn admiſſion into the Church by the Church ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating Ordinance for the time then being, which other Children were not duly capable of who were not under that Election and Call. God's placing thoſe Infants in ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as was their being under the care and tutorage of ſuch Parents, as would iſſue in their owning God for their God, and his Religion for the way of their worſhiping and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him, was his calling of them in the beginning of it, unto ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. And the Scripture uſeth to reckon little Children as having begun to do this or that, when they are but placed in circumſtances that will bring them to do it actually in the Iſſue. And thus the Children of the <hi>Roha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites of a month old were numbred with their fathers as with them keeping
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51946:21"/>the charge of the Sanctuary,</hi> when they were but in a way of being trained up to it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.28. And in this reſpect perhaps it was that our Saviour ſpake of ſome little Children as believing in him, of which I ſhall ſay more afterwards, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.6. And for the ſame reaſon it may be little Children were ſaid to enter into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God when their Parents did ſo, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.11, 12. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this enquiry; Moſt certain it is, that Infants were then received into the Church and were a part of it, as all acknowledge; and it muſt be in the reſpects which I have mentioned that they were ſo, unleſs any more likely can be named, which I cannot imagine. For other Infants of the Heathen which were not under theſe circumſtances, were not reputed Church Members, nor were in any immediate capacity of the Church initiating Ordinance.</p>
               <p>The next thing after this which would be enquired into is, whether the viſible Church memberſhip of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51946:21"/>Infants of believing Parents, was <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued</hi> or terminated by the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king place of the Goſpel miniſtration, or by any new Church ſtate under it? And I doubt not to ſay, that there are many things which will determine this queſtion againſt you in the Negative. I will begin with that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. where it's ſaid, <hi>for the gifts and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God are without repentance.</hi> Theſe words relating to the calling of ſuch Jews who as concerning the Goſpel were then Enemies for the ſake of the believing Gentiles, and yet beloved for the fathers ſake, that which I chiefly note from them is, That the calling of God, or his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient way or method of bringing the Jews to be his people, is not now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel recalled, no more than his <hi>donation</hi> or <hi>gift</hi> conferred on <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, is, when he promiſed to be their God on the terms he did, but both are ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued without any repentance in God. The way into the Church is as open, the terms of admiſſion as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51946:22"/>touching the general nature of them as eaſie, and the means of procuring it vouchſafed by God, as ſufficient now as ever they were. God hath not repented of any favour or grace that was antiently granted to the Jews whether old or young, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their being of his Church and People. And in that very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.20, 21. which the Apoſtle here in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26, 27. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites, touching the calling of the Jews in Goſpel times, it is foretold, that the ſame way of propagating Church-members and the true Religion, which God uſed in old Teſtament times, by Parents training up their ſeed in the true Religion, and by that means tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it from Generation to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſhall continue in the Church to the end of the World. For it is there ſaid, <hi>As for me this is my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them, ſaith the Lord, My ſpirit which is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51946:22"/>ſeed, nor out of the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, ſaith the Lord, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth and for ever.</hi> And accordingly we find in point of event, that (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the firſt planting of Chriſtian Churches in an extraordinary way, by extraordinary means) the ordinary way of propagating the Chriſtian profeſſion and profeſſors from age to age, hath been the very ſame with that which was uſed by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Jews of old; which was by receiving their Infant Children into the Church, and ſo educating them in the true Religion profeſſed by the grown members of the Church.</p>
               <p>For further light in this matter, let us conſider what doctrine our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our taught, and what his Apoſtles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, in relation to it. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith, <hi>Suffer the little Children to come to me and forbid them not; for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God, Mark</hi> 10.14. Which words, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God, are the reaſon here given by our Saviour, why little
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51946:23"/>Children ſhould be ſuffered and not forbidden to be brought to him. Which ſhews, that when he ſays, of <hi>ſuch</hi> is the Kingdom of God, he meant it of ſuch little Children properly as thoſe were which were brought to him, and not of men like little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in humility, innocency, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, as you would have it. For if we ſhould underſtand it in your ſenſe, then that which our Saviour gives here for a reaſon, ſeems to be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For what conſequence is there in this, or how would it follow, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> becauſe the Kingdom of God is of other perſons like little Children in other things, but altogether unlike them in what was the matter of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt their being brought to Chriſt, which was their minority, that therefore little Children pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly meant, ought to be ſuffered and not forbidden to be brought to Chriſt? And if it be meant of little Children properly, then our Saviour in theſe words aſſerts ſuch little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be of the Church, whether
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51946:23"/>you underſtand by Kingdom of God, Heaven it ſelf, or the Church on Earth. For none are of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven above, who are not firſt of the Church on Earth; for it is his Body the Church only that Chriſt is thus the Saviour of. But if this Text were to be underſtood in your ſenſe, yet it would prove that for which I alledg it, by parity of reaſon. For if that which makes adult perſons like little Children in that for which they are propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a pattern, will qualifie them for the Kingdom of God, then it muſt needs qualifie the Children themſelves for it. If you ſay that this way of arguing as well proves Doves, Lambs, and Sheep quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to be of the Kingdom of God, as little Children; becauſe they in ſome reſpects are ſet for pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns unto men, and good men upon account of reſembling them in ſome reſpects, are called by their names. I anſwer, it follows not; becauſe theſe Creatures have not rational natures
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51946:24"/>as Children have, and therefore are not capable of ſpiritual benefits as Children are: Nor were ever conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Church-members heretofore as little Children have been. By reaſon of which difference, it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the one are not Church-members becauſe the other are not, though both are propounded as pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns in ſome reſpect of that which will qualifie rational Creatures for Church-memberſhip. So that take it which way you will, the argument from the Text for Infants Church-memberſhip, is far ſtranger than any thing which can be offered againſt it.</p>
               <p>Again, in <hi>Luke</hi> 9.48. Our Saviour ſpeaking of a little Child which he had ſet by him, ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall receive this Child in my name, receiveth me.</hi> Here you have no room to pretend it meant of men qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified like Children. For it is not ſaid, whoſoever ſhall receive <hi>ſuch</hi> as this Child in my name, but whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall receive <hi>this</hi> Child (the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51946:24"/>Child then ſet by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our) in my name, receiveth me. And if that Child or other ſuch were to be received in the name of Chriſt, then that Child was, and other ſuch are ſpiritually related to Chriſt, as thoſe of his body the Church are: how elſe could they be received in his name? Now to receive one into the Church of Chriſt, is to receive one in his name, therefore ſince our Saviour would have ſome little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren received in his name, he would have them received into his Church. The words, <hi>whoſoever ſhall receive this Child in my name, receiveth me,</hi> are indefinite and not limited to any one way of receiving in his name. So that if there ſhould be more ways of receiving little Children in the name of Chriſt, than by receiving them into the Church, yet that being one way, and an eminent way too, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not according to Chriſts own Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but be highly acceptable to him to receive ſuch little Children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church as that he ſpoke of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51946:25"/>was, ſince he takes it as if he himſelf were received.</p>
               <p>Let us conſider yet further thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.6. <hi>But whoſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones that believe in me, &amp;c.</hi> If I can demonſtrate to you that this was ſpoken of little Children <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,</hi> I ſhall not need to determine in what reſpects they can be ſaid to believe in Chriſt. I can eaſily think as well as you, that they cannot be ſaid to believe in the propereſt ſenſe. They are not indeed unbelievers, as that ſignifies a wilful rejection of the terms of Grace and Salvation, which yet it may be is the common ſenſe of the word unbelief in Scripture, which is damning. And conſidering their redemption by Chriſts Death from Condemnation for original ſin, while actual is not added to it, they may be as well in a ſtate of Salvation, as actual Believers are, till actual ſin take place; and ſo be numbred with them upon that account. When our Saviour ſays, <hi>Whoſoever doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51946:25"/>the Kingdom of God as a little Child, ſhall not enter therein,</hi> it is not only implyed that little Children receive the Kingdom of God, but alſo more fully expreſt, that none ſhall receive the Kingdom of God but upon the ſame terms in ſome ſort as they do, and what can thoſe be but Chriſts Ranſom and Purchaſe, and their being free from a prevailing principle of oppoſition againſt the Goſpel and Government of Chriſt. And that may well be true in this caſe which our Saviour ſays in another, <hi>He that is not againſt us is for us, Lu.</hi> 9.50. and if little Children in ſuch a ſenſe are for Chriſt, they may well be reckoned to be of his party, and called as thoſe of his party are, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, Diſciples.</p>
               <p>The little Children of old, could no more <hi>properly enter into Covenant,</hi> nor the <hi>uncircumciſed male Child break the Covenant,</hi> nor the Children of the <hi>Kohathites of a month old keep the charge of the Sanctuary,</hi> than lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children can believe in Chriſt:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51946:26"/>and yet in ſome reſpect, and in ſuch a latitude of ſpeech as the Scripture ſometimes uſeth, they were ſaid to do all theſe things. Let the reaſon then be what it will for which they are ſaid to believe, yet that it is ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children properly taken, who in this place are ſaid to believe in Chriſt, I ſhall endeavour to evince by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That they were little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in a proper ſenſe of which our Saviour ſpake, <hi>Ver.</hi> 5. in the words next preceeding theſe in <hi>Ver.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That theſe in this 6. <hi>Ver.</hi> who were ſaid to believe in Chriſt, were the very ſame, or the ſame ſort of little ones of which he had ſpoken in <hi>Ver.</hi> 5. That they were little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in a proper ſenſe of which our Saviour ſpake in <hi>Ver.</hi> 5. when he ſaid, <hi>Who ſo ſhall receive one ſuch lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Child in my name, receiveth me;</hi> will appear, partly by the relation theſe words bear to thoſe which go before; and partly by comparing them with the relation which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51946:26"/>Evangeliſt makes of the ſame matter. In the 2. <hi>Verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chap.</hi> Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>ſet a little Child in the midſt of his Diſciples.</hi> And in the 4. <hi>Ver.</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall humble himſelf as this little Child, the ſame is greateſt in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> This little Child in <hi>ver.</hi> the 4th. is the ſame with that ſaid to be ſet in the midſt of the Diſciples <hi>ver.</hi> 2. And then in <hi>ver.</hi> 5. he ſaith, <hi>Who ſo ſhall receive one ſuch little Child in my name, receiveth me;</hi> meaning ſuch little Child as had been ſpoken of juſt before in <hi>ver.</hi> 2. and 4. And to put the matter out of all doubt, that by ſuch little Child mentioned <hi>ver.</hi> 5. our Saviour meant that very little Child that was ſet by him, or any other ſuch, and not men reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the humility, docility, or innocency of that or any other ſuch Child, the Evangeliſt <hi>Luke</hi> relating the ſame matter, <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.48. ſaith thus: <hi>Whoſoever ſhall receive this Child in my name, receiveth me;</hi> plainly ſpeaking this of that indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51946:27"/>Child, which in the very next Verſe before, Chriſt is ſaid to have ſet by him. The true ſenſe of the ſame matter related thus by both the Evangeliſts, ſeems to be this, That whoſoever ſhould receive that little Child, that very Child which Jeſus had ſet by him, or any other ſuch, in his name, ſhould by ſo doing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him. The one Evangeliſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates one, and the other the other part of our Saviours ſaying in this matter, as is uſual alſo in other Caſes.</p>
               <p>Thus far the matter before us is as clear as well could be deſired, that when our Saviour ſaid, whoſo ſhall receive one ſuch little Child in my name, receiveth me, he meant it of little Children properly. And that it was theſe very little ones ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, or this ſort, which our Saviour ſaid, <hi>did believe in him,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>but whoſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones which believe in me, &amp;c.</hi> ſeems to be as plain as the other. For to whom can thoſe words, <hi>one of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51946:27"/>theſe little ones,</hi> relate, but to them of whom our Saviour laſt ſpake? Beſides, the oppoſition here between receiving and offending, the receiving one of thoſe little Children in Chriſts name, and the offending of one of thoſe little ones, ſhews the matters ſpoken of in both <hi>verſes,</hi> 5. and 6. to reſpect the ſame ſort of perſons, which then muſt needs be little Children properly. And the oppoſition ſeems to ly thus: as he whoever he be which ſhall receive a little Child in Chriſts name as related to him, or ſo as to educate and inſtruct him in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him and his Religion, ſhall do a worthy act, ſuch as Chriſt will take as if done to himſelf: So he that ſhall turn one ſuch little Child aſide, by training him up in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Religion, ſhall do a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy act, and ſuch as would expoſe him to worſe than being drowned in the depth of the Sea. And this ſenſe of the word <hi>offend,</hi> exactly agrees with the common uſe of it in the New Teſtament.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:51946:28"/>
               <p>But yet notwithſtanding all that I have ſaid, I do not at all deny the emblematical uſe here, of the little Child which our Saviour ſet in the midſt of the Apoſtles, which was to cure them or ſome of them of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and to perſwade them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come if poſſible as free from it as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children are. And therefore tells them firſt, that except they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and became as little Children, they ſhould be ſo far from being great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the Kingdom of Heaven, the thing they contended about, as that they ſhould not at all enter therein, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. And ſecondly, he tells them, that the way for them or any other to intereſs themſelves ſo far in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as to be made greateſt in the Kingdom of Heaven, is by becoming like little Children, by purging out ſuch ill habits of pride and the like, which made them unlike to little Children, in whom ſuch ill habits had not taken place. For ſaith he, <hi>Who ſo ſhall humble himſelf as this little Child, the ſame is greateſt in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51946:28"/>the Kingdom of Heaven, ver.</hi> 4. But then though all this is granted, yet it muſt be conſidered, how and after what manner our Saviour would cure this diſtemper in the Diſciples, by this emblem of a little Child. And this he did, firſt by intimating to them how free from pride and other ill habits little Children are, till they have defiled themſelves with actual ſin. And ſecondly, by letting them know how very dear to him they are upon that account, upon their not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving actually defiled themſelves with pride, malice, or oppoſition againſt him and his Goſpel (for which reaſon perhaps he numbers them with thoſe that believe) indeed ſo dear, as that he takes what is done for or againſt them, as done for or againſt himſelf. And by thus diſcourſing to them of ſuch little Children as that was which ſtood in the midſt of them, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them touching the neceſſity of purging out ill habits, and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming humble and innocent, if ever they would endear themſelves to him,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51946:29"/>or become capable of entering into the Kingdom of Heaven, or of being great therein.</p>
               <p>By the way then, by what hath been now ſaid, you may anſwer your own argument, why you cannot think it probable that any little Children were ſaid to be baptized, when it's ſaid, ſuch and ſuch were baptized and their Houſholds. Your reaſon you know is, becauſe it is ſaid of ſome of them, that all of thoſe Houſholds did believe. Which yet is no reaſon to disbelieve little Children to be any of thoſe <hi>all,</hi> if the little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Believers are ſaid by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to be Believers, as you may ſee they are, by what hath been now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to you, unleſs better reaſon can be offered againſt the ſenſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, than what is offered for it.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>THus far we have heard what our Saviour hath ſaid touching the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51946:29"/>continuance of little Children in the viſible Church under the Goſpel: Let us now hear what his Apoſtles ſay. In the firſt Sermon they preached af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had received the Holy Ghoſt, St. <hi>Peter</hi> uſed this as a motive to thoſe Jews who had Crucified Chriſt, to repent and be baptized for remiſſion of ſins; for ſaith he, <hi>the promiſe is to you and to your Children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call, Act.</hi> 2.38, 39. This clauſe, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call, ſhews that which I have been proving, to wit, that the promiſe of ſpiritual benefits or priviledges, was not made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> ſeed meerly upon account of their relation to him according to the fleſh, but as they ſhall be his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Children in deriving from him the profeſſion of the ſame Faith or Religion which was in <hi>Abraham.</hi> And ſo and upon theſe terms the promiſe was made to the Jews here ſpoken to as bad as they were, and to all afar off, whether Jews or Gentiles, upon
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51946:30"/>ſuppoſition of their being called, and not to them only, but to their <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren alſo.</hi> Now I have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the little Children in the Jewiſh Church, could not have been of it no more than the Children of the Gentiles, but by being ſome way or other <hi>called</hi> to it, as they were whom God put under the nurture of believing Parents, or Tutors, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe terms the Gentiles Children might be of the Jewiſh Church too, as the Children of the Strangers that were born in the Houſe of him that was a Jew, or bought with his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, were. By this part of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon you may ſee, that under the Goſpel, the promiſe continued to all ſuch as were called, both of Parents and Children, juſt as it was before; I mean as to ſpiritual priviledges. The promiſe now is to as many both Parents and Children as God ſhall call, and it was no otherwiſe before. The Apoſtles words here run but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenour of the promiſe of old, and according to what was
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:51946:30"/>enjoyed in old Teſtament times, both by Jews and Proſelytes, and their Children. The Proſelytes from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles upon their being called, were of old <hi>grafted into the ſtock of Iſrael, and their Children with them, and did partake of the root and fatneſs of the Olive Tree,</hi> as the Apoſtles phraſe is: that is, they were partakers of the ſame ſpiritual priviledges as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpiritual Seed were. Thus the Proſelytes were then, and the believing Gentiles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel were no more: they were but grafted into the ſame ſtock or Olive Tree, <hi>i. e.</hi> into the ſame Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. I ſay into the ſame Church, for that continued ſtill, though not all the ſame Laws, and was conſtituted of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpiritual Seed as before it had been. Which brings me to the next thing I would call you to the conſideration of.</p>
               <p>When St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. ſpeaking of the unbelieving Jews, ſaith, <hi>becauſe of unbelief they were broken off,</hi> it doth appear thereby,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51946:31"/>there was no diſcontinuance of the Church by any change made by the Goſpel upon its firſt entrance. This is implyed when it's ſaid of ſome Jews that they were <hi>broken off.</hi> For it was the Church, the ſame Church from which they were broken off, of which they were branches or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, until they were broken off. But then the Church it ſelf remained ſtill in being at that time when they as branches were broken off, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo, into which others were grafted. The caſe was plainly this. Before Chriſts appearance in the fleſh, the Jews generally both better and worſe, profeſſed a belief in Gods promiſe of ſending the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and that he ſhould be of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, in which Seed all Nations were to be bleſſed. By profeſſion of which faith, or this and the Religion of <hi>Abraham</hi> otherwiſe, they were all externally <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Spiritual Seed, and as they were his Spiritual Seed, they were the Church of God. When the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Meſſias</hi> was come, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51946:31"/>thereby fulfilled, and a new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation made touching his being come, and that Jeſus the Son of the bleſſed Virgin was he: ſome of them believed this and ſo kept their ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Church, in as much as by that belief they continued to be the Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as they were before by their former Faith. Whereas the other Jews who did not believe this, but oppoſed the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it in thoſe that did, ceaſed thereby to be ſo much as nominally, or by profeſſion the ſpiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo became broken off from the Church, being now his Seed but after the fleſh only. This which is indeed the plain truth, and eaſie to be underſtood, is point-blank a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your contrary opinion and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, on which you much build, touching the diſſolution of the Church which had been Jewiſh, when the Church as Chriſtian did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence. The belief of a new Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, did not make a new Church, but the Church in being before, had
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51946:32"/>thereby a new illumination, and their faith changed into a belief, that that now was done, which they believed before would be done. The Church conſidered as well before as after the entrance of the Goſpel into the World, is reſembled by one ſtanding Olive-Tree that had ſome branches broken off and others grafted in.</p>
               <p>And as the ſame Church continued under the Goſpel which did exiſt or was in being before, ſo the very ſame Church-members kept their place and ſtanding in it which were of it before, except ſuch as were broken off by <hi>unbelief.</hi> And if ſo, then thoſe little Children which were of the Church immediately before their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents became Chriſtian, did not ceaſe to be ſo by their Parents becoming ſuch, nor by any alteration which the Goſpel made. For if thoſe who were broken off, were broken off by unbelief, according to the Apoſtles expreſs aſſertion; Then unleſs thoſe little Children I ſpeak of, were guilty of unbelief in themſelves, or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51946:32"/>had it imputed to them from their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, they could not be broken off, but ſtill kept their place and ſtanding in the Church of God. But guilty of unbelief by imputation of it from their Parents, they could not be, for they were Believers. Nor could they be any more guilty of it by any act or omiſſion of their own, than they were while as <hi>Abrahams</hi> Spiritual Seed they were of the Church before. And therefore the only reaſon and cauſe of the diſchurching of thoſe who were diſchurched, not being found in thoſe little Children, they could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be diſchurched by any alteration which the Goſpel made.</p>
               <p>You may further obſerve, how that ſuch expreſſions are uſed in the holy writings of the New Teſtament, as do denote the Children of believing Parents to be <hi>holy,</hi> to be ſeparated to God now as well as they were in old Teſtament times. Thus when the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Hebrew Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and their Seed, of which the Chriſtian Church was firſt conſtituted
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51946:33"/>as the <hi>firſt-fruits unto God,</hi> and how it was like to continue as the <hi>root or ſtock</hi> into which the believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles in part were already, and were further to be grafted, he ſaith thus in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. <hi>If the firſt-fruits be holy, the lump is alſo holy, and if the root be holy, ſo are the branches.</hi> In old Teſtament times if the root were holy, if the Parents <hi>Abrahams</hi> Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Seed were holy, the branches their little Children were holy alſo, as coming under the ſame denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with their Parents. And we here ſee the Apoſtle aſſerts the ſame thing to be now, and to take place under the Goſpel diſpenſation. He doth not ſay in reference to times paſt, if the root <hi>were</hi> holy, ſo <hi>were</hi> the branches, but with reference to the time preſent, if the root <hi>be</hi> holy ſo <hi>are</hi> the branches.</p>
               <p>And as here St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the Sanctification of the Seed of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Believers, ſo elſewhere he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts the ſanctification of the Children of the believing Gentiles, when he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51946:33"/>ſaith, <hi>The unbelieving husband is ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the wife, and the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wife is ſanctified by the husband: elſe were your Children unclean, but now are they holy,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. If we ſhould read this Text according to your interpretation of it thus; elſe were your Children <hi>Baſtards,</hi> but now they are <hi>Legitimate,</hi> we ſhould impoſe ſuch a ſenſe upon the Apoſtles words, as would repreſent him as ſpeaking untruly. For certainly the Children of Heathen Parents born in lawful Wedlock, were no Baſtards, although the Parents were neither of them Believers, nor neither of them ſanctified by faith, or by means of the faith of the other. Whereas the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the Children here ſpoken of, did depend upon the faith of one of the Parents: if one of them had not been ſanctified by means of the faith of the other, their Children would have been unclean, and yet not Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards neither, provided the Parents were lawfully Married before either of them believed. If then your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51946:34"/>be not the true ſenſe of the Text (and you ſee for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it cannot) then what can ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be aſſigned for it, and ſo agreeably to the current tenour of the Scriptures, as thoſe Childrens being ſeparated together with their Parents, from Heatheniſm to Chriſtianity, from Idols to God, from being without God and Chriſt in the World, to be related to him as members of his Church, choſen and called out of the World, by which they became <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto all that hath been already ſaid, let us add in the laſt place, that little Children together with their Fathers, are expreſly called Diſciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. Where it's ſaid, <hi>Why tempt ye God to put a yoke upon the neck of the Diſciples, which neither we nor our fathers were able to bear.</hi> That which is here called a putting a yoke upon the neck of the Diſciples, was the urging the neceſſity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelyting the believing Gentiles with their Children by Circumciſion, after
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51946:34"/>the manner of <hi>Moſes, ver.</hi> 1. Now the manner of initiating Proſelytes of the Gentiles according to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was to Circumciſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his Male Children too, if he had any, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. And therefore the Children of the believing Fathers as well as their Fathers themſelves, muſt needs be underſtood to be thoſe Diſciples upon whoſe necks this yoke was endeavoured to be put. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the plain and genuine ſenſe of this Text in all probability, I muſt needs ſay it is but a faint put off and weak evaſion to eſcape the force of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony given in this Text to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipleſhip of ſome Infants, for you to alledge that it was the <hi>doctrine only</hi> of the falſe Teachers impoſed upon the Parents and other grown perſons, who only and not their Infants were able to underſtand it, that was the yoke, the only yoke that was endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be put upon the neck of the Diſciples here, and that therefore they only muſt be here meant by the Diſciples upon whoſe neck the yoke
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51946:35"/>was endeavoured to be put. For this Doctrine of falſe Teachers, was no further a yoke or burden, than as it referred to the thing thereby urged to be practiſed. The yoke or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den which St. <hi>Peter</hi> a Jew here ſaith, neither they nor their fathers were able to bear, was the pain they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went in being Circumciſed, and the coſtly Sacrifices and other external burdenſome obſervances which by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was laid upon them: and this really, or Circumciſion which was a part of it, was the yoke or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den which the falſe Teachers would now have impoſed upon the believing Gentiles and their Children, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation. And this was that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo called the <hi>yoke of bondage,</hi> wherewith he would not have the Believers <hi>intangled again, Gal.</hi> 5.1. Which did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt only in doctrine: for he preſently by an inſtance ſhews what he meant by it and wherein it did conſiſt, ſaying, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Behold, I Paul ſay unto you, that if ye be circumciſed Chriſt ſhall
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51946:35"/>profit you nothing.</hi> And the like he had done before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.9. <hi>How turn ye again to the weak and beggerly elements, whereunto ye deſire again to be in bondage;</hi> inſtancing wherein in the next words: <hi>ye obſerve days, and months, and years.</hi> This yoke of bondage then we ſee, did conſiſt in more than meerly doctrine. The neck of the Diſciples muſt needs be the neck of all thoſe who were to have born the yoke according to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> if they had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by it, as the falſe Teachers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they were: and ſuch were Children of eight days old, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt were to have been brought under that yoke, had the falſe Teachers prevailed. To reſtrain then the ſenſe of the word <hi>yoke</hi> to doctrine only, when as the thing ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by that doctrine, was the yoke which the Children were as much to bear as their Parents, is as I ſaid but a weak evaſion. I deny not but that adult perſons are primarily meant and intended by Diſciples in this place:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:51946:36"/>but that they only were ſo with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of little Children, is that which you will never be able to prove, ſince it's certain that the falſe Teachers did no leſs impoſe the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Circumciſion upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren than upon the Parents. Though it's true they began with the adult, and the diſpute lay between the adult and them: for they could not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the Children, but by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Parents to accept of the impoſition, both for themſelves and for their Children. In that Infants are not in an immediate and the moſt proper capacity to learn of Chriſt, makes you think I ſuppoſe that the Scripture ſhould not call them Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: But that need not make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to you, when you conſider what I have already ſhewed, and need not here repeat; How that little Children in Scripture account, are eſteemed to be or to do this or that in a religious reſpect, when yet they are but firſt put into a way, or but brought near a proper capacity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51946:36"/>or doing it; when they are but placed in ſuch circumſtances as will iſſue there, and which makes it viſible to men that they will do ſo. How elſe ſhould little Children be ſtiled Believers, and be ſaid to do ſeveral other things every whit as remote from their capacity in the propereſt ſenſe, as their learning of Chriſt is? I could ſhew I think by many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Scripture, that things are ſaid to be, or to be done when they are but viſible in their foundation or cauſe.</p>
               <p>Thus (to give you one inſtance) our Saviour ſaid of the family of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus, This day is ſalvation come to this houſe, for as much as he alſo is the ſon of Abraham, Lu.</hi> 19.9. The name of the effect is given to the viſible cauſe; Salvation is ſaid then to be come to the family of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> becauſe he himſelf being become a Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> would in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability be a means of bringing his Houſhold to be ſo too. Beſides, in Scripture account, as are the Parents,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51946:37"/>ſo are their little Children reputed to be. If the Parents are counted <hi>the ſeed of the bleſſed of the Lord, ſo are their off-ſpring with them, Iſa.</hi> 65.23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.26. If they are called from the reſt of the World into a near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to God, as his ſpecial or pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people, or to be his <hi>Diſciples</hi> (which is but another name for the ſame thing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.16.) ſo were and are their Children with them. And in ſome ſort they are accounted to do that in their ſomewhat remote religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Progenitors (much more in their immediate Parents) which they did. And thus <hi>Levi paid tithes in Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Heb.</hi> 7.9. And when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaid whoſo ſhould receive one of thoſe little Children, he ſpoke of, in his name, would receive himſelf; it is intimated that in doing ſo, they ſhould receive ſuch Child as ſpecially related to him as Diſciples are. And to receive them in his <hi>name,</hi> and to receive them as his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> ſeem to be two words ſignifying but the ſame thing, as appears by comparing <hi>Mark</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:51946:37"/>9.41. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.42. Where both expreſs the ſame thing in different phraſes. That which one calls a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to one a Cup of water in <hi>Chriſts name becauſe he belongs to Chriſt,</hi> the other calls, <hi>a giving it to one in the name of a Diſciple.</hi> And to receive little Children into the Church of Chriſt (which is one way of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them in his name) which is his Family, is to receive them as Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or Scholars into his School, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by him there to learn his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which may well give them the denomination of his Diſciples. And the account which I have now given why little Children are called <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> may ſerve as reaſons alſo why they are ſaid to <hi>believe</hi> in Chriſt.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>Having now heard what doctrine our Saviour himſelf and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles after him have taught con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the little Children of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Parents, and in what viſible ſtate
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51946:38"/>they ſtand in relation to Chriſt and to his Church, I think you will find little room left for you ſo much as but once to imagine that the Goſpel when it took place, put a period to the viſible Church-memberſhip of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
               <p>Let us now conſider from what hath been ſaid, in what capacity ſuch Infants ſtand in reference to Baptiſm. And can any man that doth conſider them, <hi>forbid water that theſe ſhould not be baptized?</hi> If ſuch Infants are as much of the Church, and as much <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpiritual Seed, as ever In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in the old Teſtament Church were, then they can be no more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable than they were of a ſolemn admiſſion into the Church by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of initiation for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as Baptiſm is now, as Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was then. That which qualifies any for viſible Church-memberſhip, certainly qualifies them for Baptiſm. <hi>All were baptized into one body</hi> that were of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. And ſuch Infants can be no leſs capable of the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51946:38"/>ſpiritual ends of Baptiſm now, than they were of the ſpiritual ends of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion then, which were, and which are, much-what the ſame. And if it be ſo acceptable a thing to Chriſt for us to receive one ſuch little Child in his name, as that he takes it as well as if we received Him, nay takes himſelf to be received in our ſo receiving it (which could not well be if it were not a member of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the Church) can you then think it a thing diſpleaſing to him to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize ſuch in his name, when as that is a ſacred Rite appointed by him for a ſolemn receiving ſuch in his name in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Church, as do belong to him, as doubtleſs ſuch Infants do, or elſe they could not be received in his name? And when Chriſt hath given Commiſſion to diſciple all Nations and baptize them; can you fancy that the ſame Commiſſion implies a prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to baptize little Children though they are <hi>Diſciples?</hi> If little Children are made Diſciples in their Parents being made ſo, and that in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51946:39"/>Gods account and by his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then to baptize them certainly cannot be a deviation from Chriſts Commiſſion to baptize Diſciples. And laſtly, if our Saviour hath ſaid it of ſome little Children that they believe in him, then the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion which authorizeth the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of Believers, muſt authorize the baptizing of them. The Commiſſion is general to baptize Diſciples indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, and therefore muſt needs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to all that are ſo, or that are Believers, though but in the loweſt ſenſe. Theſe are no forced, or far fetcht conſequences, but flow natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from their premiſes.</p>
               <p>And whereas the Scripture ſpeaks of Baptiſm as the Sacrament of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation or new Birth, which you make as an argument againſt the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of it to Infants, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their incapacity for Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: you ſhould conſider firſt, that Circumciſion was a Sacrament of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation as well as baptiſm is, and yet Infants were not uncapable of it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51946:39"/>upon any ſuch account. Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Letter, was a ſign of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Circumciſion, of that made without hands, the Circumciſion of the heart, and was a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith. And what thing more ſpiritual than this, is I pray you ſignified by Baptiſm? Which conſidered, the ſpirituality of baptiſm in nature or uſe, is no more an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Infants capacity for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, than the ſpiritual uſe of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was an argument againſt that. And this is ſufficient to take off your argument.</p>
               <p>But you may conſider yet farther, that Infants even while ſuch, muſt needs be capable of Regeneration in one ſenſe or other; unleſs you will ſay they are not in a ſalyable ſtate, which yet you have not been wont to ſay; or elſe that unregenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may go to Heaven and be ſaved, contrary to that of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> And therefore you ſeem to be under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51946:40"/>of granting Infants to be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Regeneration in a ſenſe more or leſs proper. And if you think Regeneration moſt properly and ſtrictly taken to be incompetent to an infant ſtate, as Regeneration ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that new ſtate into which a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is brought by a change in the frame and temper of the mind and will, and by a regulation of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and operations of the Soul in reference to their ſeveral objects; then you muſt be conſtrained to accept of another ſenſe of Regeneration, and ſuch as is more competent to an Infant State; unleſs as I ſaid you will ſay, that perſons may go to Heaven in an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate State.
<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. Mat.</hi> 19.28.</note> Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince the word tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Regeneration,</hi> according to the aſſertion of learned men, and the reaſon and nature of the thing it ſelf, doth properly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a <hi>new or ſecond ſtate,</hi> it follows, that if it can be proved that Infants are brought into a new or ſecond State, or capacity of being happy,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51946:40"/>other than what is natural to them as deriving from <hi>Adam</hi> or their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Parents, which is called a being <hi>born of blood</hi> (<hi>John</hi> 1.13.) then they may be ſaid to be in a regenerate ſtate. And that the whole Race of <hi>Adam</hi> are put into a <hi>new ſtate</hi> or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for happineſs by the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> after they had loſt it by the firſt, until they fall into actual Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt God by actual ſin in their own perſons (of which ſure they are in no danger while they are but in their infant ſtate) may I conceive be ſufficiently evinced from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. where the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>as by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of one Judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one, the free gift came upon all men unto the juſtification of life.</hi> And the ſame might be backt by many other Scriptures. And it may well be that it was in reſpect of this new ſtate into which little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are brought by Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> that our Saviour ſaid, <hi>of ſuch is the Kingdom of God.</hi> Now ſo far
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51946:41"/>as Baptiſm ſignifies our Communion in the virtue of Chriſts Death and Reſurrection by which our <hi>ſtate</hi> is changed, as well as our conformity to it by a moral change in our <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> there is in Infants, or conferred upon them, that ſpiritual grace which anſwers the outward ſign in Baptiſm. And that ſuch a change of condition as to be raiſed out of a ſtate of death into which we were brought <hi>for ſin,</hi> into a ſtate of life by <hi>forgiveneſs of ſin,</hi> by virtue of Chriſts Death and Reſurrection, is called a being <hi>quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together with him,</hi> as well as that moral change which is made by ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, is a thing which ſeems fairly to lie in thoſe words, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13. <hi>And you being dead in your ſins, and the uncircumciſion of your fleſh, hath he quickened together with him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forgiven you all treſpaſſes.</hi> And let me ſay this further, that it ſeems not improper neither to ſay that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are dead to ſin, to actual ſin in their own perſons, in as much as we cannot ſay, <hi>that luſt hath conceived</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:51946:41"/>in them ſo as <hi>to bring forth ſin</hi> by any conſent of will: though it's true they are not dead to it as having mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, they having not yet, while In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, contracted any ill habits to mortifie. So that as burying with Chriſt in Baptiſm ſignifies a death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin in the perſon baptized, there is in ſome ſort that in Infants which anſwers the outward ſign in baptiſm in that reſpect alſo. Theſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, you may well infer, that if that <hi>new ſtate</hi> into which Infants are brought, be in ſome reſpect a new birth, a birth from above, and ſuch as puts them into an immediate capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city for Salvation, as well as Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, in the common acceptation of it, does the adult; (and you ſee by what reaſon you are perſwaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is) then you have as great, yea greater certainty of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtate of Infants in this ſenſe, than you have of the regenerate ſtate of any adult perſons, in the other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Regeneration; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a more certain ground to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51946:42"/>baptize them, ſo far as Regeneration in a perſon is a reaſon or ground of baptizing him, than you have to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize the adult.</p>
               <p>Conſidering farther that the words of our Saviour's Commiſſion did run in general terms to diſciple all Nations and baptize them; how can you think that the Jews or the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves could underſtand otherwiſe thereby, than that the Children of the converted Gentiles and Jews too ſhould with their Parents be received as Proſelytes to the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and as ſuch baptized, unleſs they had had caution to the contrary, which if they had, there would have been no place for controverſie in this matter. The reaſon of the unlikeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of their underſtanding other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, is taken from a uſage among the Jews, by which they did initiate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes both Fathers and Children from among the Nations of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, by <hi>baptizing</hi> as well as <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing</hi> them. A thing which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by the more learned
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51946:42"/>among your ſelves, and which you may find recited by ſeveral of our Engliſh Authors out of the writings of the ancient Jewiſh Doctors, as by Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> for one in his <hi>Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> upon <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.1. <hi>John</hi> 3.5. See alſo <hi>Ainſworth</hi> on <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12. The reception of the Proſelytes into the Church in this way, the Jews eſteemed a <hi>new birth:</hi> unto which our Saviour ſeems to refer in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>except a man be born again of water and of the ſpirit, he cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of God, Jo.</hi> 3. And when <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> groſly miſ-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood our Saviour, and demanded how can theſe things be? our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our replied and ſaid, <hi>art thou a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in Iſrael and knoweſt not theſe things?</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, is this any ſuch ſtrange thing which is ſo like what is familiarly practiſed among your ſelves? This conſidered, they by Chriſts commanding them to Diſciple or Proſelyte all Nations bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them, could not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51946:43"/>but that they were now to go abroad into all the World to Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte the Nations to Chriſtianity, and to enter them in the Chriſtian Church by Baptiſm, both Parents and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, like as now and then a family of them had been formerly Proſely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Jews Religion, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into their Church. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the recorded inſtances in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of perſons baptized that had Houſholds, makes it probable in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with other circumſtances, that when the Father or chief of a Family was converted to Chriſtianity and baptized, his Houſhold was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized alſo, as it had been before pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the reception of Proſelytes. Of all thoſe in Scripture who by name or perſonal deſcription are ſaid to have been baptized, there are but nine ſo far as I remember, beſides our Saviour; to wit, <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> the <hi>Eunuch, Saul</hi> called <hi>Paul, Cornelius, Lydia,</hi> the <hi>Jayler, Criſpus, Gaius,</hi> and <hi>Stephanus.</hi> The Eunuch had no Children, and was baptized-upon the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51946:43"/>road. <hi>Paul</hi> had none not being Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. Whether <hi>Simon</hi> had or had any Houſhold, is not ſaid. And whether <hi>Gaius</hi> at that time had any Houſhold when he was baptized, is uncertain. But the other five of the nine who had Houſholds, their Houſholds came into the Church with them by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as the Houſholds of the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes formerly had done. If then we may make a Judgment of what was uſually done, by ſo many inſtances in Scripture as we have of what was done in this Caſe, we ſhall not want reaſon to incline us to think, that when the Apoſtles did baptize any that had Houſholds, that it was their uſual practice to baptize all thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that were of their Houſholds, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch as <hi>rejected the counſel of God againſt themſelves, and were not baptized,</hi> which little Children could not do. It was not without its ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that of old the great promiſe of Grace to the World by the <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> was made to Families, <hi>in thy ſeed ſhall all the families of the earth
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51946:44"/>be bleſſed:</hi> as if Gods deſign ſignified thereby, was to bring the Nations of the World into the Church by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, as the event ſhews he hath done for the moſt part, both before and ſince the Goſpel diſpenſation. The Proſelytes of the Gentiles of old as well as the Jews, came in by Families: and we ſee by the inſtances before-mentioned, that the Chriſtians came in by Families, and were baptized by Families alſo. And the Church hath been ſtockt by Families, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion tranſmitted down from Age to Age, from Parents to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and from Maſters to Servants.</p>
               <p>It will ſeem the leſs ſtrange to you, that when the Father of the Family was converted to Chriſtianity, his Houſhold was brought into the Church with him, if you conſider upon how ſmall appearance of becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtians, adult perſons were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and received into the Church in the Apoſtles days, and by them. When we read in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.7.11. that ſuch as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that hour continued to eat of the Idol
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51946:44"/>ſacrifice with conſcience of the Idol,</hi> are yet called <hi>brethren</hi> though weak bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren indeed, you may eaſily gueſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on how little appearance of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, perſons were received into the Church; and ſo you may by the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that ſoon proved great ſcandals in the Church, by whom the way of truth was evil ſpoken of. When in the ſame hour of the night in which St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached the Goſpel to the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and his Houſhold, they were all baptized, they did not long ſtand Candidates for Church-memberſhip, nor could attain to much knowledge in the Chriſtian Religion into which they were baptized. No doubt but the door into the viſible Church is far wider than the gate of the Church as inviſible, and of the Kingdom of Heaven. I do not find that any were refuſed that were willing preſently to be baptized, how bad ſoever they had been before or proved to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, no not <hi>Simon Magus</hi> himſelf, than whom there could hardly be a worſe.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51946:45"/>But then it muſt be remembred, that Diſcipline was appointed for the cure of diſtempers in the Church, and for the purging it of the notorious ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous members.</p>
               <p>Theſe things I have the rather men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to render it the more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that little Children were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed where whole Houſholds were baptized, when there were any ſuch in thoſe Houſholds. For if adult and grown perſons were baptized and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Church upon ſuch eaſie terms as I have ſhewed they were: if they were baptized when there was but any fair probability that they would own the Chriſtian Religion for the future, though but by ſo little appearance of ſuch a thing as was viſible in ſome of them when they were baptized; Then it is not unlikely but that they might baptize ſome little Children alſo, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom circumſtances conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there was every whit as great a probability that they would own, profeſs, and aſſert the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51946:45"/>for the future, as there was that their Parents would: in as much as Parents ſtill uſe to educate their Children in the ſame Religion which they themſelves profeſs.</p>
               <p>Unto all which let me add this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; That the Judaizing Chriſtians who contended with the believing Gentiles for not obſerving the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> in Circumciſion, meats, and days, never that we find quarrelled with them for not entering their Children into the Church, as by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> they were to do when they themſelves were received as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes, nor for not baptizing them according to the cuſtom of the Jews, both in reference to their own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and the Children of Proſelytes. Nor do we find that the unbelieving Jews ever conteſted with them for any ſuch thing, though otherwiſe they were forward enough to lay hold of any thing they could to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt them. All which ſtill ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it probable that there was no ſuch thing wanting in the believing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51946:46"/>Gentiles, as might give either the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daizing Chriſtians or unbelieving Jews any occaſion for ſuch a quarrel, which otherwiſe we may well think would have riſen among them.</p>
               <p>But leaving theſe things, ſuppoſe it were granted you (which yet will not be) that the Scripture were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſilent as to matter of fact touching the baptizing of Infants in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles days; yet when we find in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſufficient reaſon why they might and ſhould have been then baptized, it may well induce belief that they then were and now may. We do not find as to matter of fact, that any of ſix of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> were baptized, nor of ſome other Churches of the Apoſtles planting: but yet that's no good argument that there was none, ſo long as there is ground enough to conclude that they ought to have been baptized, for that they were a part of that one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church that hath <hi>one baptiſm</hi> belonging to it for the ſolemn incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration and initiation of all its
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51946:46"/>members, of all that are qualified for Church memberſhip. We do not read in Scripture that the Jews bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized the Proſelytes, both Fathers and Children, when they received them into the Church, and yet we are otherwiſe ſatisfied that they did. So that you ſee it can be no good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that Infants were not baptized in the Apoſtles days, though it ſhould be ſuppoſed and granted that we have no record in Scripture that they were. I have told you before, that if this way of arguing were good, it would oppoſe and run down your own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice as much and more than Infant Baptiſm. Becauſe there is nothing at all recorded in Scripture as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, that gives the leaſt hint that any were baptized at age whoſe Parents were Chriſtian at their birth. So that either the baptiſm of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is recorded in the recording of the baptiſm of Houſholds, or elſe the baptiſm of none is recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture but of ſuch who immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their being baptized, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51946:47"/>from Judaiſm or Paganiſm: I mean as to what was done after Chriſts Reſurrection. This argument from matter of fact I know hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken much with people of weak minds, who cannot <hi>ſee a far off,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks in another caſe, and hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed your Congregations with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes to your way; but doth indeed wound your cauſe, and gratifieth none but <hi>Socinians</hi> in their opinion that none ought to be baptized but ſuch as are newly converted to Chriſtianity from another Religion.</p>
               <p>And it is not a thing to be ſlighted in reference to this matter of fact, That Authors of good credit in the antient Church, who lived in times not far diſtant from the age in which the Apoſtles or one of them lived, did aſſert Infant Baptiſm to be an <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Tradition,</hi> and to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from them and practiſed in the Church from their times downwards, as many Books before you have made it appear. And that which yet adds the more credit to their teſtimony is,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51946:47"/>in that they were never contradicted in this their report and teſtimony by any that lived in the ſame age with them or near to it, no not by <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> himſelf, though otherwiſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his opinion, of all ſin paſt being waſh'd away by Baptiſm, he would have had it deferred, except in caſe of danger of death in Infants, not only till perſons were paſt Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but till after Marriage and the heat of youth was over, if not till old age or towards the time of death. Neither could ever any Advocate of your cauſe ſo far as I can learn, give any account ſhort of the Apoſtles times, of the firſt riſe of Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
               <p>But not example in matter of fact, but the reaſon and ground on which they ſtand or do depend, is our rule. And therefore the reaſon and ground from Scripture why ſome Infants may be baptized, I reckon is more to be attended to than the evidence of fact. And theſe I have laid before you already and ſhewed; That the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51946:48"/>reaſon of allowing the viſible Church-memberſhip of ſome Infants, is the ſame now as it was in old Teſtament times; ſuch as is Gods chuſing them to it, ſanctifying and ſetting them apart for it, and calling them to it. That Gods gift in granting this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge in the days of the Patriarchs, and his calling them to it, is <hi>without repentance</hi> and unrepealed. That they are as much qualified for the Church initiating Ordinance now as ever heretofore, and as capable of the ends thereof. That our Saviour hath owned their ſpecial relation to him by appointing them to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his name. That he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged them to be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe that believe in him. And that our Saviour and his Apoſtle hath put them into the number of Diſciples. That they are in a ſenſe in a regenerate ſtate. All which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, plainly ſhow them to be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for Baptiſm, according to the very Letter of Chriſts Commiſſion. And if there be ſubſtance in theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51946:48"/>as I doubt not but there is, Then Infant Baptiſm is far from being a <hi>Nullity.</hi> And whatever I have ſaid heretofore in times long ſince, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the tenour of theſe reaſons, I hereby <hi>Revoke,</hi> and do think I have given you ſufficient reaſon for my ſo doing, and for every one of you to do ſo likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Conſidering then what lies in your way, you will find it a difficult task to ſatisfie your ſelves (or to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers any tolerable account that you can ſatisfie your ſelves) that Infant Baptiſm is a <hi>Nullity.</hi> And it is ſo much the more unreaſonable for you to think that it is, when yet thoſe who have been baptized in their Infancy, do agree with you in the doctrine of baptiſm, touching the nature and neceſſity of it, and the reaſons and ends of it; and hold themſelves as much obliged by it, as you do by yours: and the ſincere of them do as well and as much perform their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as thoſe among you do who are ſincere.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:51946:49"/>
               <p>AND if theſe things be ſo as I have endeavoured to repreſent them from the Scriptures; and if In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm be indeed no Nullity: Then ſo many of you muſt needs be under a dangerous miſtake and guilty of the odious ſin of Schiſm, who think it a ſufficient ground to ſeparate from Chriſtian Congregations, for that they have not been otherwiſe baptized than in their Infancy, and which deny Church Communion with them to be lawful for that reaſon, and practiſe upon it accordingly. For this is a <hi>Cauſleſs and unwarrantable rent and breach made in the body of Chriſt the univerſal Church:</hi> which is <hi>Schiſm</hi> in the formality of it. Nay it is Schiſm of a higher nature than ordinary. The Schiſm in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and the like in other Churches, which was ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the Apoſtles Epiſtles, as that ſcarce any thing was more, was but a proud, uncharitable, and unpeacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faction, and ſiding in a particular
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51946:49"/>Church, which did not proceed ſo high as to ſeparation of one part of the Church from the other in publick worſhip and Church Communion. Nor was ſuch a thing at all practiſed then by any Chriſtians, upon any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, though there were great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders among them, but only by ſuch as St. <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith, <hi>were ſenſual not having the ſpirit, ver.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>And if Schiſm was ſo highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned when it never roſe to that height among Chriſtians as to deny Communion one with another in the publick worſhip to be lawful: What can we think of ſuch a Schiſm then as for you <hi>without cauſe</hi> to deny the lawfulneſs of holding Communion with almoſt all the Churches of Chriſt in the World (except thoſe few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations which have been rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed) and to practiſe accordingly; not to mention your cenſuring them to be no true Churches, nor any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them properly a Chriſtian, but people of the World? If the little Schiſms in the Church which never
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51946:50"/>proceeded to ſeparation, were thought of ſuch ill conſequence by the Apoſtles, as that they laboured hardly in any thing more in their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, than to prevent and ſuppreſs them: Then certainly ſuch a Schiſm as yours, cannot in reaſon but be of as much more a criminal nature, and of ſo much worſe conſequence, as the unchurching of almoſt all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches in the World, is worſe than thoſe leſſer diviſions in the Church were; notwithſtanding which they kept on foot their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the ſolemn worſhip. The Schiſm which conſiſted in ſeparation we ſee was perpetrated by none then but thoſe vile <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> who though they pretended to more knowledge and perfection than was in them they withdrew from, yet ſuch was the opinion the Apoſtles had of them and their ſeparation, as that they were not afraid to ſay, they were <hi>ſenſual not having the ſpirit.</hi> Which I note, not as judging you to be as bad men as thoſe Gnoſticks were, (ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51946:50"/>aſide your Schiſm) but to put you in mind that notwithſtanding the great diſorders that were in thoſe Churches, and the want of the due exerciſe of Diſcipline in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and ſeveral of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> yet no good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians then ever attempted to erect ſeparate Communities for reformation ſake, much leſs were ever encouraged ſo to do by the Apoſtles, but the quite contrary.</p>
               <p>Now if the Apoſtles had ſuch a deep ſenſe of the miſchievous nature and effects of Schiſm, as put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch ſtrenuous endeavours to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or ſupreſs it, as we find they uſed: Methinks this ſhould awaken you to reflect upon your ſelves and what you have done by your ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in making ſuch a rent as you have done in the Church of God, and what the effects of it have been.</p>
               <p>I know you cannot be without all ſenſe of what ſad effects our Church diviſions have produced; Such as is the expoſing of our holy Religion,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51946:51"/>to the ſcorn and contempt of Atheiſts, Infidels, and Papiſts, and the tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe to become ſuch which were not ſo before: and ſuch as is the diſcompoſing, unſetling, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the minds of many well meaning, and well-deſigning, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious people, to the betraying them into the hands of Seducers, who have made their advantage of our diviſions: and ſuch as is the diverting of mens minds from the ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, ſtudy, and practice of the weightier matters of Religion, and the engaging them in contentious Janglings, and uncharitable Cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and Revilings, to the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of true Chriſtian Charity and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the placing Religion much in opinion, and in being of a different form and party; and ſuch as is the expoſing of us all to the danger of the breaking in of Popery, by ſtrengthening their hands who are of that way, and by weakening our own, and by incouraging them in hopes of prevailing at laſt to practiſe upon us,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51946:51"/>and by all their Arts to improve the advantage we have put into their hands by our diviſions and diſtractions. You cannot be ignorant how many have taken their way to <hi>Quakeriſm and Scepticiſm</hi> through your Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations; like <hi>wandering ſtars,</hi> having firſt left the Parochial Aſſemblies, have promiſed themſelves this and that ſatisfaction, firſt in one new form and then in another, until they have run themſelves out of breath, and at laſt quite loſt themſelves and ſeldom returning.</p>
               <p>And if upon review and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you find, as doubtleſs you may, that your ſeparation, which with the ſeparation of others, hath brought forth ſuch bitter fruit, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on miſtaken grounds, and been undertaken without any juſt cauſe: what work then will here be for repentance, that ever you have been acceſſary to ſuch miſchiefs as thoſe before-mentioned are, and what need is there for you that are Leaders, to ſound a <hi>retreat</hi> to your followers!
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51946:52"/>I can aſſure you it hath been matter of no ſmall humbling to ſome, when they have perceived the bad effects of ſuch ſeparation, that ever they had their hands in it: The ſenſe of which bad effects alſo, firſt put them upon ſuch a ſerious review of the grounds on which they firſt ſet out in it, as by means whereof they came to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the weakneſs and unſoundneſs of thoſe grounds. And as what I have herein done to help you to a ſight of your miſtake, is intended as a real ſervice to you; ſo I ought to preſume that it cannot but be judged to be ſo by ſuch as are ſincere lovers of truth, if they can receive thereby any ſuch benefit as is deſigned them by it.</p>
               <p>And if any ſhall receive conviction, and yet for their reputation ſake among their party, and for fear of the reproach of inconſtancy, ſhall ſtill perſiſt in their way contrary to the conviction of their own mind; let them conſider, that ſuch will hardly be able to <hi>buy</hi> the <hi>truth</hi> with the price
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51946:52"/>of liberty, eſtate, or life, that are ſcared from a publick owning of it, by the corrupt breath of ſuch inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and heady perſons, which cannot excuſe them by anſwering for them to God, to whom every one muſt <hi>give an account for himſelf.</hi> Let it be remembred, who and what they were who <hi>believed on Chriſt,</hi> and yet would not <hi>confeſs</hi> that they did, becauſe <hi>they loved the praiſe of men,</hi> of their own party, <hi>more than the praiſe of God, Joh.</hi> 12.42, 43. and who they were that <hi>could not believe, becauſe they ſought ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour one of another, and not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that comes from God only, John</hi> 5.44. I the rather mention theſe things to you, becauſe I know in part how ſtrong a temptation of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is, and how hard to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. But let it be conſidered, that it is not counted a diſparagement to any man that he is not infallible, when as it is truly diſhonourable for any to carry it as confidently as if he were, when almoſt all knowing and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51946:53"/>good men in the World, are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind. It is in the Judgment of the wiſeſt, truly commendable and praiſe-worthy, for a man to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and retract his error when he is convinced of it. If this ſhould not be admitted, what place is left for men to grow in knowledge, or to perfect that which is lacking in their repentance, which is not done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a change of mind? There are few men that arrive at any great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but have found occaſion to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their opinion in many things.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>THere is another principle of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration beſides this of Infant Baptiſm, which is common both to you and thoſe of the <hi>Congregational way:</hi> and though you differ in the former, yet in this you are one. This principle of ſeparation conſiſts in an opinion, <hi>that none are to be held Communion with in Church-fellowſhip, who are not in the Judgment of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51946:53"/>Church ſavingly called and ſavingly ſanctified:</hi> which you and they call <hi>a Judgment of Charity or of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> This is an opinion, and the practiſing upon it a thing plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by the teſtimony of the Scriptures, both in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the new. This I have ſhewed already in this diſcourſe. And to what I have already ſaid, I ſhall add one or two things more. The one is, that herein you and they take upon you to judge in matters, wherein you neither are nor can be competent Judges. He that judgeth a man to have ſaving Grace or not to have it, muſt paſs a Judgment of what is in the heart and not of his outward actions only. And this is the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of God only, who as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, <hi>only knows the hearts of the Children of men,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.39. and therefore may not be uſurped by men. It's true indeed we may and muſt judge the beſt of men with a Judgment of Charity ſo far as there is any ground to hope well of them in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51946:54"/>reference to their ſtate Godward; but we muſt not take upon us to judge in the <hi>Negative,</hi> againſt men in the worſe ſenſe; that is, that they have no ſaving Grace, or which is the ſame, that they are in a damnable condition, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they have thoſe black Characters on them, for which the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly excludes them from having <hi>any inheritance in the Kingdom of God and of Chriſt,</hi> ſuch as are enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. We may judge of mens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared principles and actions in order to their reception to, or rejection, or at leaſt ſuſpenſion from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church, when we may not judge of their ſtate Godward. A man may be ſo ſcandalous as for which to be deprived of Communion with the Church, when yet we may not judge that man to have no Grace. <hi>If any man obey not our word by this Epiſtle, note that man, and have no company with him that he may be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Yet count him not as an enemy but admoniſh him as a brother,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:51946:54"/>3.14, 15. The reaſon of all which I have ſignified already, which is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are incompetent Judges in this, at leaſt unleſs they are mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly wicked perſons. The part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing difference between the loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſaving grace, and that which is but common grace is ſo little, and to the wiſeſt of men ſo undiſcernable, that it is impoſſible but that they will be in great danger of judging them to have no ſaving grace that have, who ſit in Judgment upon that matter: Yea and of depriving them alſo of thoſe Church priviledges which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your own tenent they have a right to, having ſaving grace. And thus in going about to weed out the tares, <hi>you will root up the wheat alſo,</hi> contrary to the mind of our Maſter. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.29. When our Saviour ſaith, <hi>judge not that ye be not judged, Mat.</hi> 7.1. as he would not have us ſevere in judging other mens words and actions, or intentions, ſo much leſs their ſtate and ſtanding before God. <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51946:55"/>mans Servant? to his own Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter he ſtandeth or falleth, Rom.</hi> 14.4. And again, <hi>who art thou that judgeſt another, Jam.</hi> 4.12. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of him that is a Jew, not outwardly but inwardly, and whoſe Circumciſion is not outward in the fleſh but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in the heart, <hi>That his praiſe or approbation is not of men but of God:</hi> it is not of men <hi>deciſively</hi> or determinately, but of God only who knoweth the heart. And if it be not of men, then men ſhould not attempt it or undertake it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28, 29. That's one thing.</p>
               <p>Another which reſpects thoſe of the Congregational way chiefly, is this: That their practice in purſuance of their principle aforeſaid, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the conſtant practice of the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians. We do not find, that they refuſed any adult perſons Communion with them in the Supper of the Lord, who had been received into the Univerſal Church by Baptiſm, but only in caſe of being orderly proceeded againſt in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51946:55"/>a way of Church cenſure for notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſcandalous offences: but that ſuch as were baptized <hi>continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles doctrine, and in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bread and prayer, Acts</hi> 2.41, 42. And the Proſelyte ſtrangers of old who were Circumciſed, were by Gods appointment admitted to the ſame Church priviledges as the Jews were, <hi>Exo.</hi> 12.49. Whereas thoſe of the Congregational way, though they baptize their Children, yet refuſe them Church Communion when they are grown, if they have any ſtrong ſuſpicion that they have no ſaving grace, although they never came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Church Cenſure for notorious ſcandalous offences. Which is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and unſcriptural way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, and ſo much the worſe in them who ſcruple ſome things becauſe not commanded in Scripture, though they be not forbidden. So that their foreſaid principle of ſeparation in Conjunction with their practice of baptizing their Children, renders them inconſiſtent in their way, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51946:56"/>their way contradictious in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>There are further great inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, to ſay no worſe, attending this practice of theirs. Firſt, they have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by prepared a way to Anabaptiſm, and give occaſion for many to take their way to that throughth eir Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, as <hi>taking a degree</hi> towards it there. For when ſome have perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the interferings that are in their way in baptizing perſons into the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church, and yet not to receive them into their particular Churches, nor permitting them Communion with them therein when come to Age, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion, but upon a new account of ſpecial grace; they have been thereby drawn to think the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts more true to their principles than they, and that then the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of perſons may be as well defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red till they have ſpecial grace, as their particular Church-memberſhip may, and ſo upon that account among others, have gone over to them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hereby ſome who may
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51946:56"/>have no ſaving grace, are in great danger of being betrayed into ſelf flattery, and into a being confident that they have, becauſe ſo good and knowing a Congregation as they eſteem ſuch a Church to be, hath judged that they have; and ſo reſt ſecure in an unſafe condition. Which made ſeveral of the <hi>New-England</hi> Miniſters after their long experience of the effects of this way, at laſt in their joint anſwer to Mr. <hi>Davenports Apologetical Preface, p.</hi> 43, 44. to ſay thus: <hi>Indeed when men confound theſe two, and do tie viſible Church-memberſhip unto ſuch conditions and qualifications, as are enough to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: this may tend to harden men and to make them conceit, that if they be got into the Church, they are ſure of heaven; whenas alas it may be they are far from it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, A guiltineſs of a great Schiſm in the Church, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the many ſad effects of it; ſome of which I have mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. If the ſeparation built upon
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51946:57"/>the principle under conſideration, had been matter of duty by vertue of that principle, they that have enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in it would not have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for the evils conſequent upon it, no more than they were of ſetting Father againſt Son, and Son againſt Father, Mother againſt Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Daughter againſt Mother, by preaching the Goſpel, <hi>Lu.</hi> 12.53. But whoſoever hath undertaken a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from, though but part of the Church, upon inſufficient grounds and miſtaken principles, muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for the ill effects and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of it, until they repent and leave off, as well as for the Schiſm it ſelf which cauſed them. But now I have already repreſented to you, why a Judgment in the Church that perſons have not ſaving grace, cannot be the rule of non-admiſſion of them to particular Church Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, ſuppoſing them to have been baptized into the Church Univerſal: and I have ſhewed likewiſe how that in the account of Scripture, ſuch have
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51946:57"/>been viſible Church-members, and externally related to God and to Chriſt, and called by his name, and denominated Saints, upon another account than that of ſaving grace or internal holineſs. Which if truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, then it cannot be matter of duty but the contrary, to ground a ſeparation from ſuch Congregations as are conſtituted upon other terms, and becauſe they are ſo.</p>
               <p>In that thoſe of the Churches men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture have been ſtiled Saints, it is no argument why none are to be admitted to Church-fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip but ſuch as are Saints in a ſaving ſenſe, though this principle of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration I now ſpeak of, is wont to be grounded on that. For ſome in thoſe Churches which were not Saints in that ſenſe, were yet ſtiled Saints from their being ſeparated and ſet apart to own and profeſs the worſhipping of the moſt holy God only, and to be of his holy Religion, as I have ſhewed both in this diſcourſe and elſewhere more at large. Saints then was the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51946:58"/>common appellation of thoſe that profeſt the Chriſtian Religion, as Chriſtian is now: and was not then uſed to diſcriminate the ſincere from the unſound Chriſtians, as it is now. This was a device of a later date, and is too like that of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> which does appropriate the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being Saints unto ſuch only as they eſteem to have been eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religious. The concluſion then is, that if the ſeparation of theſe friends with that of your own, be unaccountable from the Scriptures, then they and you muſt needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for it, as an unlawful and naughty Schiſm, and for the many evils produced by it, until pardon be obtained by repentance, which none can promiſe themſelves, but upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>THE laſt thing I ſhall obſerve from the foregoing diſcourſe, is, that it doth afford us a ſubſtantial
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:51946:58"/>ground for <hi>National Churches:</hi> That is, it affords us ground to conclude, that the whole body of a Nation who are baptized into the Univerſal Church, and that profeſs Gods true Religion, are in that reſpect <hi>ſubject matter</hi> of a Church; though this is indeed a thing which lies croſs to your thoughts, and which you are wont to oppoſe with ſome indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The whole body of the Nation of the Jews, as was ſhewed before, were by Gods call and their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Abrahams</hi> Spiritual Seed, and as ſuch were <hi>Church matter,</hi> and a Church <hi>inorganically</hi> conſidered. And for the ſame reaſon if the whole body of a Nation now by Gods call and their profeſſion of the true Religion, become <hi>Abrahams</hi> Spiritual Seed in a ſenſe, they muſt needs be as well Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church matter, as the Nation of the Jews were.</p>
               <p>Now that other Nations which have profeſt Gods true Religion, have thereby become <hi>Abrahams</hi> Spiritual Seed in a large ſenſe as well as the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51946:59"/>Nation of the Jews ever were, we have good reaſon to believe, not only from the nature of the thing it ſelf, but alſo from the Scriptures. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto Abraham, My Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is with thee, and thou ſhalt be a father of many Nations: a father of many Nations have I made thee, Gen.</hi> 17.4, 5. Which is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in a reſtrained ſenſe, of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a father of many Nations <hi>by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural generation only,</hi> but alſo if not only of his being <hi>a ſpiritual father</hi> of many Nations, who were to derive their being, and what they ſhould be in a ſpiritual or religious capacity, from him from whom the true ſaving doctrine hath been ſince propagated; firſt, to the Nation of the Jews, and then to Nations of the Gentiles. And thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> interprets the aforeſaid promiſe of God to <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4.16, 17. —<hi>That the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed, not to that only which is of the law, but to that alſo which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all, as it is
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51946:59"/>written, I have made thee a father of many Nations.</hi> Now if <hi>Abraham</hi> be, hath been, and ſhall be, a ſpiritual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many Nations, then many Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons muſt needs be his ſpiritual Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: For Father and Children are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laretives, and in what ſenſe the one is a Father, the other muſt be his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>if ye be Chriſts, then are ye Abrahams ſeed</hi> (<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29.) is true of all that are ſo, and in the ſame ſenſe in which men are Chriſts, in that ſenſe they are <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, whether it be by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion only, or by a ſound Faith alſo.</p>
               <p>And in correſpondence to all this, <hi>the Kingdoms of this World are ſaid to become the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his Chriſt.</hi> Which muſt be underſtood of their becoming profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Goſpel of Chriſt or the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.15. And this hath come to paſs according as was foretold by the Prophets as well as to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in one inſtead of many, <hi>Zech.</hi>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:51946:60"/>2.11. <hi>Many Nations ſhall be joined to the Lord in that day, and ſhall be my people.</hi> As the Nation of the Jews were Nationally Gods people, and God was the God of Iſrael; ſo here it's foretold, that many Nations nationally ſhould be joined to him and be his people alſo, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he muſt be the God of thoſe Nations in the ſame ſenſe in which they are his people.</p>
               <p>Thus far the matter is ſo evident, that one would think that nothing but an inveterate prejudice and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion of a contrary opinion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duly taken up, and an averſeneſs to confeſs your ſelves to have been miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſhould hinder you from accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a conviction in this matter, and of yielding up your judgments as conquered by the truth. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed then yet farther. If Nations profeſſing the true Religion, are in a more general ſenſe <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Seed, and a people joined to the Lord ſo as to be his people, Then it is as well the duty of the people of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51946:60"/>ſuch Nations to aſſociate and knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Chriſtian Congregations for publick worſhip in the places where they reſide, as it was for the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians who lived in <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Corinth,</hi> in <hi>Cenchrea</hi> by <hi>Corinth, &amp;c.</hi> to aſſociate as they did in the ſame places for the ſame end; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly thoſe Churches were called by the names of the places where they did reſide. And our Parochial di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution is no more a cauſe of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, than that was that the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and the Church at <hi>Cenchrea</hi> were diſtinct upon the <hi>only account</hi> that the members of each lived in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct places. And as the diſtribution of the whole Nation of Profeſſors of Chriſtianity into particular Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Aſſemblies, beſt anſwers the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive pattern,</hi> ſo it beſt anſwers the <hi>ends</hi> of Church aſſociation, ſuch as are the watching over, conferring with, admoniſhing, exhorting, and comforting one another, and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling together for publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:51946:61"/>
               <p>And when the Chriſtians in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are thus diſpoſed of into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations in the places where they live, weak and ſtrong together, it is no ways agreeable to primitive pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, nor to the general ends of Church aſſociation, nor to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of particular Churches, or of the whole body of Chriſtians in a Nation, for the ſtronger, the wiſer, the better, the more ſpiritual in thoſe Pariſh Churches, to withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the more ignorant, weak, and carnal Chriſtians, reſiding in the ſame place with them, into diſtinct and ſeparate Communities, ſo long as they can hold Communion with them without ſinning in ſo doing. This the Primitive Chriſtians did not: and if no ſuch thing had been done in our Nation, the Church of God amongſt us would doubtleſs have been in no ſuch bad circumſtances as now it is.</p>
               <p>As God hath placed in the natural body members ſome more neceſſary and uſeful than others, to be helpful and ſerviceable to the meaner, more
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51946:61"/>helpleſs and leſs uſeful, for the good of the whole body: ſo it is in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical bodies. <hi>God,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, hath tempered the body together, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given more abundant honour to that part which lacked; that there ſhould be no Schiſm in the body,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.24, 25. That there ſhould be no Schiſm in the body: as to be ſure there will and needs muſt, when that part is moſt neglected which lacketh moſt care and pains, and withdrawn from as if it were no part of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. This becomes a ſore temptation to thoſe who are deſpiſed, to ſet againſt thoſe who deſpiſe them, and that again tempts them on the other ſide, to oppoſe their oppoſers, and ſo the breach grows wider and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſpreads it ſelf through the whole body of a Nation. And as the withdrawing live coals from thoſe that are but a little kindled, is the way to put out the fire: ſo is the withdrawing of the better Chriſtians from the worſe, not in a way of Church Diſcipline, but into diſtinct
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51946:62"/>bodies, the direct way to ruine the Church, and to extinguiſh the life and heat of Religion in thoſe places where this is practiſed. I nothing doubt but that thoſe who have taken this courſe, let the provocation to it be what it will, might have conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the real and true intereſt of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the main, much better in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. This way ſavours too much of ſelf-ſatisfaction, and neglect of others, to be of Chriſt, who would have the <hi>ſtrong to bear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the weak, and not to pleaſe themſelves, after his own exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Rom.</hi> 15. New ways many times take much for a while which do not end ſo well at laſt. <hi>Enquire for the old way and ſtand in the good way,</hi> that in which the primitive Chriſtians walked, if ye would find reſt and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in your own minds, reſt to your Souls.</p>
               <p>And if it be matter of duty in it ſelf, and according to primitive pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice for all Chriſtian Profeſſors in a Nation thus to unite in particular
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51946:62"/>Congregations in the places where they reſide, and not to make any Schiſm after, by one part withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the other into ſeparate Communities, ſo long as they can continue their Communion without a neceſſity of ſinning; Then if the Higher Powers in ſuch a Nation do exerciſe their authority in command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to do this which is of it ſelf their duty, though they had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, and do likewiſe forbid and reſtrain their making of Schiſms by ſeparating when they have no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient or warrantable cauſe to do it; this cannot make it leſs their duty than it was of it ſelf before, and ſtill would be, were there no ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or reſtraint from the Higher Powers. No man ſure can imagine that if <hi>Nero</hi> had uſed his authority in commanding the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches to do the ſame things which they were obliged to do though he had not commanded it, as he did not, that <hi>Nero</hi>'s Command in that Caſe would have made it any
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51946:63"/>whit leſs their duty, but the more.</p>
               <p>It is not unbecoming but very lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable no doubt for the Higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to concern themſelves and their authority in promoting the Chriſtian Religion in their Dominions, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king order that God be publickly and ſolemnly worſhipped by the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in the uſe of Goſpel Ordinances: That places for publick worſhip be provided for that end: That Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers competently qualified, be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to adminiſter thoſe Ordinances: That fitting maintenance be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and provided them, that they may attend that work without diſtraction: That the people be required and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to attend the publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and that care be taken that they may not be diſturbed in it: and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally that Diſcipline be duly exerciſed for the purging of the Churches, and for the keeping them pure. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Higher Powers and the people of a Nation to be Chriſtian, the very <hi>light</hi> of nature, and their <hi>love</hi> to the Religion they profeſs,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51946:63"/>will dictate ſuch things as theſe, in the one to Command, and the other to obey, and to uſe all due means to prevent diviſions amongſt them, as being moſt deſtructive to all Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of men, and to the flouriſhing of Religion.</p>
               <p>I do not find that in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> there was any direction or command in particular, that when that people ſhould chuſe them a King, that he ſhould uſe his authority in cauſing both Prieſts and people to do their Duty in the ſeveral parts of Gods Worſhip, enjoined by <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, any more than Kings now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Teſtament are in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular appointed and required to ſee that the Chriſtians under them, both Miniſters and People, do their duty in matters relating to Gods publick Worſhip. And yet when <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> for inſtance, to reſtore Religion after a decay of it in his Dominions, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Prieſts and Levites to do the duty of their places according to the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and with advice
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51946:64"/>of the Princes, ſummon'd the People of the Land to come and keep the Paſsover, and the like: in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion it is ſaid thus of him. <hi>Thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that which was right and good, and true before the Lord his God: and in every work which he began in the ſervice of the houſe of God, and in the Law, and in the commandments to ſeek his God, he did it with all his heart and proſpered,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 31.20, 21. And if this and the like in other good Kings was highly acceptable to God, as we ſee it was; then we have little reaſon to think it ſhould be diſpleaſing to him when Kings now do any thing like it. <hi>He is the miniſter of God to thee for good,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13.4. and ſo long as he promotes the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good in things temporal or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, he is not out of his way. If it were a thing ſo well pleaſing to God for <hi>Abraham</hi> to command his Children and his great Houſhold to keep the way of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51946:64"/>the Lord, as that God himſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded him for it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. it cannot certainly be an offence to him for Kings to command their Subjects to do likewiſe. It was no ſmall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that God promiſed to the Church when he ſaid, that <hi>Kings ſhould be their nurſing Fathers, and Queens their nurſing mothers:</hi> and it would be great ingratitude not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be ſo, when they uſe their power and authority, not only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and incourage them in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Chriſtian Religion, but alſo in making proviſion as Nurſing Fathers for their ſpiritual nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. And the truth is, the more the Higher Powers concern themſelves in due ways to promote Religion in their Dominions, the more uſually it flouriſheth: as we ſee not only by examples in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and other Hiſtory, but experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth us that there is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the leaſt face of Religion in ſuch places as have been moſt neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the publick proviſion.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:51946:65"/>
               <p>I would adviſe thoſe among you who are moſt tender in this point touching the Magiſtrates Power in matters of Religion, to hear what is ſaid in anſwer to a Queſtion of this Nature, by <hi>J. O.</hi> in ſome Sheets in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>Two Queſtions concerning the power of the ſupream Magiſtrate about Religion and the worſhip of God; with one about Tythes, propoſed and reſolved:</hi> Whoſe words I know they will more regard than anothers. The Queſtion is, <hi>Whether the Supream Magiſtrate in a Nation or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of men, profeſſing the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, may or ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert his power Legiſlative and Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, for the ſupportment, preſervation, and furtherance of the profeſſion of the faith, and worſhip of God; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he may and ought to forbid, coerce, or reſtrain ſuch principles and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices as are contrary to them, and deſtructive of them?</hi> The Anſwer to which, is managed under ten Heads of Arguments. <hi>The affirmative</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of both parts of this Queſtion is
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51946:65"/>proved,</hi> 1. <hi>From the light and Law of Nature.</hi> 2. <hi>From the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> 3. <hi>From Gods Inſtitution in and by Laws poſitive, upon Doctrines of faith and ways of worſhip, of pure Revelation.</hi> 4. <hi>From the example of all godly Magiſtrates accepted with God from the foundation of the World.</hi> 5. <hi>From the promiſe of Goſpel times.</hi> 6. <hi>From the equity of Goſpel rules.</hi> 7. <hi>From the confeſſion of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches in the World.</hi> 8. <hi>From the confeſſion of thoſe in particular, who ſuffer in the World, on account of the largeneſs of their Principles, as to toleration and forbearance.</hi> 9. <hi>From the ſpiritual ſenſe of the generality of godly men in the World.</hi> 10. <hi>From the pernicious conſequences of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary aſſertion.</hi> This was good Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in 1659.</p>
               <p>And if upon apprehenſion and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, ſuch Higher Powers do judge that all the Chriſtian Miniſters and People in their Dominions, are never like to prove ſo wiſe and ſober, as not to abuſe an abſolute liberty,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51946:66"/>by making <hi>different parties</hi> in the Church, by chuſing <hi>different ways of adminiſtration:</hi> and if to prevent this, and to preſerve Peace and Unity in the Church, as of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their edification and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and for the honour and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chriſtian Religion, and for the better propagation of it, they have thought it beſt to preſcribe ſome method and form to be uſed by all, it is to be ſeriouſly conſidered by you, That if nothing in that method and form be enjoined you as a condition of Communion, which is not ſinful for you to ſubmit to, Then which is moſt eligible, whether to ſeparate, or to ſubmit to that method and form, though it ſhould not, in your appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, be ſo uſeful, beneficial and grateful to you, as a liberty for you and your Miniſters would be, to uſe what way you liked beſt? If you ſay, to ſeparate is moſt eligible and fitteſt to be choſen in this caſe: Then you muſt prove that which no man will ever (I think) be able to do, to wit,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51946:66"/>That it is lawful to break Churches to pieces upon the account only of ſome conveniencies you deſire, and inconveniencies which in your appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion you ſuffer, when otherwiſe you might lawfully and without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing your ſelves with ſin, continue and maintain your Communion in thoſe Churches, to your own and their edification with whom you were united. No doubt but the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences that were on foot between the Judaiſing and Gentile Chriſtians in the Apoſtles times, did ſomewhat burden their Communion together in the ſame Church, with ſome conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inconvenience; and ſo did the ſcandalous opinions and practices of many in the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and other Churches, make the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which thoſe had with them who had <hi>not defiled their garments,</hi> the leſs pleaſant and comfortable, and in ſome reſpect burdenſome to them. But we hear nothing of ſeparation and breaking of Churches in pieces upon that account, nor of any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51946:67"/>given thereto by the Apoſtles, but the quite contrary.</p>
               <p>To bring this buſineſs down from above, let us try it a little in your own Court. Suppoſe the Higher Powers ſhould not have concerned themſelves in preſcribing any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon form to be uſed in all particular Churches in their Dominions, but had left them all at liberty to do that which ſhould be right in their own eyes. And ſuppoſe again that any other Eccleſiaſtical Power over the whole ſhould have thought fit to have preſcribed the ſame Form for all the Pariſh Churches which now is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Higher Powers in this Nation, or ſome other as diſſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to ſome. Nay to go lower, ſuppoſe yet further, that the ſeveral Pariſhes or particular Churches had not been under any ſuch general Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Power, nor ruling over the whole neither, but each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregation had been under its own Government only. And ſuppoſe in this caſe, that the ruling, prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:51946:67"/>or major part in one or more ſuch Independent Congregations, ſhould have thought it fit to have ſuch a form uſed in their own Congregation as is now preſcribed by our Higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or ſhould have done or cauſed to be done in the publick adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſomething elſe as unacceptable to part of ſuch a Congregation as the form now preſcribed by our Higher Powers, is to you. Yet the queſtion would ſtill be, which would have been moſt Chriſtian in either of theſe Caſes, whether to divide, ſeparate, and break the Church to pieces, or to ſubmit to the uſe of it to avoid ſuch a breach, and the bad effects of it, until they could in a peaceable and regular way, have obtained their deſire, or come to better ſatisfaction in their own minds? Suppoſing ſtill that all this while, the diſſatisfied part had been put upon doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſinful in it ſelf, but only what was leſs uſeful and deſireable in their own apprehenſions. And if you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of ſeparation upon any account
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51946:68"/>leſs than that of neceſſity when men muſt ſin or ſeparate, or an utter fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure in the means of edification, you open a door to confuſion in, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to the Church. It is upon this very account of neceſſity that we juſtifie our ſeparation at firſt from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now if ſuch things as now ſuppoſed, did proceed from any other Church Governing Power, were it indulged to by the Higher Powers, would be no good ground of ſeparation, neither then can they be any, when they proceed from the Higher Powers. For let them proceed from the one or the other, it doth not alter the nature of the things themſelves, otherwiſe than as the ſtamp of authority may make that in ſome degree neceſſary in <hi>uſe,</hi> which was and ſtill is but indifferent in its own nature, and might have been uſed, or another in the ſtead of it.</p>
               <p>Now ſee then where you are, and to what you are brought. If you cannot prove that to join in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51946:68"/>worſhip of God adminiſtred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Liturgy, is a Sin; then if you refuſe to do it, and ſeparate from the Church becauſe of it, you make yourſelves guilty of as great a ſin as the monſtrous effects of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Schiſm and ſeparation argues it to be. And you cannot prove that your joining in the publick worſhip adminiſtred by our Liturgy, is a ſin, unleſs you can prove that ſomething therein appointed for the publick worſhip, and which you muſt join in, if you join in the publick worſhip at all, is contrary to ſome inſtitution, rule, or Precept of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which I preſume you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to do. And the reaſon is, becauſe the things for which we pray therein, and for which we give thanks, are agreeable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; they are <hi>prayer, matter, and thanksgiving matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then for the external circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Form and Method, you cannot prove theſe unlawful, becauſe it is no where forbidden in Scripture
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51946:69"/>to preſent your prayer, matter, or thankſgiving matter to God in ſuch an external form and method as is uſed in the Liturgy, but rather countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced therefrom, as by our Saviours di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting his Diſciples to uſe a Form of Prayer, and by the forms of Prayer in the Pſalms compoſed to be uſed as Prayers. The title of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. is this; <hi>A prayer for the afflicted when he is over-whelmed, and poureth out his complaint before the Lord.</hi> The title of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. is this; <hi>A prayers of Moſes and the man of God.</hi> The 72. <hi>Pſalm</hi> ends thus; <hi>the prayer of David the Son of Jeſſe are ended. Hezekiah the King, and the Princes, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Levites to ſing praiſe unto the Lord with the words of David and Aſaph,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29, 30. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath no where determined, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prayer ſhall be made with the uſe of a Book or without, or whether longer or ſhorter, or whether in our publick Devotions, one or two, or more ſhall be uſed, or whether all ſhall be pronounced by the Miniſter
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51946:69"/>only, or part by the people alſo. We do not count it unlawful to pray to and praiſe God with united voices in ſinging of <hi>Pſalms.</hi> Now where we are left at liberty in theſe things, there it cannot be unlawful in it ſelf to uſe, either the one way or other, as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances direct. Some circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may make one way or mode con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient at one time and in one caſe, and other circumſtances may make another more convenient at another time, and in another Caſe, about ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal forms of worſhip. If our Lord had not intended us a Chriſtian liberty in outward forms, there is no doubt but we ſhould have had as particular direction in them as we have about the ſubſtance. And we may well uſe the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in exhorting one another to ſtand faſt in this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty wherewith Chriſt hath made us free. I mean in uſing this liberty one way or other, as it tends to Peace, Charity, and edification, and not the contrary as ſome urge it.</p>
               <p>The Jews had their Liturgy in their
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51946:70"/>Synagogues, at the uſe of which our Saviour we may preſume uſed to be preſent, in as much as we find he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented the Synagogue where he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Lu.</hi> 4.16. The antient Church before Popery lookt out into the World, had their Liturgy; and ſo have other reformed Churches beſides ours unto this day. And we in this Nation ſo far as I can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, have only been ſo unhappy as to break our ſelves in pieces about it.</p>
               <p>Whoever ſoberly conſiders what hath been the effect of caſting off the Liturgy and the eſtabliſhed Church Government in this Nation, and of the liberty that was taken in the late times of liberty, may by this time be pretty well reconciled to it again, whatever his thoughts may have been heretofore. Can any conſidering man think that the Church of God and the concerns of Religion in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuffered at that rate by reaſon of the reſtraint put upon it by the Liturgy, before our late ſad diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51946:70"/>brake out, as it hath done by thoſe ſundry ſtrange ſects, monſtrous opinions and practices, violent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, ſore breaches and diviſions, and the effects of theſe which that little time of liberty in which the Liturgy was caſt off and the bonds of Government broken, hath produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced?</p>
               <p>Suppoſe there were or are ſome things ſuperfluous or wanting in our Liturgical Form of Adminiſtration, or that it might be mended, or a better way pitcht upon, if the Higher Powers over us thought it fit: if this ſhould be granted, yet this is no argument why you may lawfully ſeparate: It is not its being leſs uſeful or leſs deſireable to you than it might be made, that will bear you out in your ſeparation, ſo long as you ſhould do nothing in it ſelf ſinful in worſhipping God in the uſe of it. The queſtion is not at all whether this or another way were moſt eligible, were you at liberty to chuſe without danger of making any Schiſm: But the great queſtion to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51946:71"/>which you muſt bring your ſelves is, Which is moſt eligible, whether to do that which comparatively you think is inconvenient, leſs profitable, leſs uſeful, but yet not unlawful, or to make your ſelves guilty of a great and notorious Schiſm, and therein of a great Sin, and thereby alſo to make your ſelves accountable for the moſt diſmal effects of our ſad breaches and diviſions; the very thought or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of which, is enough to make the ſtouteſt heart to tremble. Do not flatter your ſelves with this and that apology and pretence, for this ſeems to be clearly the State of your Caſe.</p>
               <p>You talk of more purity of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, for the ſake whereof you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate; but if you make your ſelves guilty of Schiſm to obtain a more pure Communion, and ſuch a Schiſm as hath already produced moſt lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table effects, in vain do you flatter your ſelves with a conceit of a more pure Communion. For your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion being <hi>founded</hi> in a great
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51946:71"/>Schiſm, muſt needs <hi>pollute</hi> it, and make it far more impure than Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Communion can upon any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable account be ſuſpected to be. You cannot ſay Parochial Communion is at all impure, becauſe a man does not defile himſelf with ſin in making his way to it, or having his ſhare in it, as they do that make their way to yours through a ſinful Schiſm. So that upon the whole matter, there is incomparably more cauſe to ſcruple Communion in your Aſſemblies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your circumſtances, than Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in our Pariſh Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Nor does a defect in the exerciſe of Diſcipline by reaſon whereof ſome are admitted perhaps to Parochial Communion that ſhould be debar'd it, make the Communion impure to them who cannot help it. A man is to <hi>examine himſelf,</hi> and then he may eat of that bread and drink of that Cup: his examining anothers Caſe is not made the condition of it. There were but <hi>a few names</hi> in the Church
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51946:72"/>of <hi>Sardis,</hi> but what had defiled their garments and were dead, having only a name to live, and yet thoſe few held Communion in the ſame Church, without defiling their own, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.4. You may if you pleaſe exerciſe that Diſcipline which the Scripture directs private perſons to uſe towards ſcandalous Church-members; that is, not to <hi>keep Company with them, or to eat or drink with them</hi> in a way of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, voluntary and unneceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. But this is no bar againſt doing your duty in coming to Gods Ordinances and in Communicating with others there who have not ſo defiled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as was ſaid before. The want of due Diſcipline, is indeed a great Calamity: but Diſcipline is not of the eſſence of the Church, no more than the rod is of the Family, but is only neceſſary for the well being and good Government of it.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <p>THere are two things I perceive which ſome of you make much of. The one is, <hi>that when any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a condition of Communion, which is vehemently ſuſpected to be unlawful, it frees a man from the guilt of Schiſm, although he break Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion upon it.</hi> The other is, <hi>that when that is impoſed as a condition of Communion which ought not to be made a condition, if Schiſm be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned thereby, the guilt of it lies only on the impoſers, and not on them upon whom it is impoſed.</hi> It argues in my opinion that arguments run very low with you, when you are fain to make ſhift with ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe: Mens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of things, or ſuſpicious concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, does not alter the nature of the things themſelves, or make that no Schiſm which is ſo in it ſelf. It may make a difference in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the offence to be greater or leſſer before God, according as men have been diligent or negligent in the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51946:73"/>uſe of means to underſtand their duty in order to practice, but does by no means excuſe them from all guilt in the Caſe, for the reaſon aforeſaid. This Poſition therefore is doubtleſs falſe.</p>
               <p>But is there indeed ſuch a virtue in ſuſpicion, as to ſanctifie Schiſm it ſelf, and to make it to be no Schiſm though otherwiſe it were? Why then I pray you, will not your ſuſpicion do as much on the other hand? Why does not your ſuſpicion of making your ſelves guilty of a notorious Schiſm, make that very lawful for you to do to avoid it, which were it not for the danger of Schiſm, and the evil of thwarting publick Laws, might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſeem inconvenient for you to do? Is there more danger in doing that, in the doing whereof it is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to you whether you do well or ill in reference to your perſonal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, than there is in doing that which it's certain tends to ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick a hurt and damage as Schiſm does?</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:51946:73"/>
               <p>When you alledge <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. where it's ſaid, <hi>he that doubteth is damned if he eat, becauſe he eateth not of faith: for whatſoever is not of faith, is ſin:</hi> I ſay, when you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this to juſtifie your Schiſm up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of your doubting of the lawfulneſs of ſome things in the adminiſtration of holy things; you make things equal in your apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which are altogether unequal in themſelves. The Caſe there touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was about the eating or not eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch meats, the eating of which the Chriſtians were not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to by any Law of God or Man: in which Caſe a man might be ſure he ſhould not offend againſt either, in forbearing to eat that about which the doubt was raiſed, nor againſt the publick peace of the Church. But you are at no ſuch liberty in your Caſe: it is not a matter of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, whether you make a Schiſm in the Church, and act contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to publick Laws, as it was for a man to forbear one ſort of food, by
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51946:74"/>the forbearing of which, he ſhould do no hurt to the Church by diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the peace of it, nor to Religion, by cauſing it to be evil ſpoken of. But yet that is not all, but your caſe and that there ſpoken of, is vaſtly different in another reſpect. The doubting of ſome Chriſtian Jews touching the lawfulneſs of eating ſome meats, which the Chriſtian Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles did eat without ſcruple, did ariſe from a want of ſatisfaction in their own minds touching the abrogation of the Moſaical Law, by which the eating of thoſe meats was once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbidden. So that your caſe is no ways parallel with theirs there handled by the Apoſtle; unleſs you could ſhew that thoſe undetermined circumſtances in the adminiſtration of holy things, the uſe of which you ſcruple, had been expreſly forbidden by ſome Law of God, the abrogation whereof you queſtion; which you will never be able to do. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Text is altogether imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently alledged to juſtifie you in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51946:74"/>your practice, as many more have been.</p>
               <p>If you ſay, though theſe words, <hi>whatſoever is not of faith is ſin,</hi> be brought to confirm a particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, yet they contain in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves an univerſal one: Admit this, for I will not deny it; yet they will not prove the contrary; that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is of faith (in this ſenſe of faith) is no ſin; that is, it does not prove that whatſoever a man is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded is no ſin, is therefore no ſin. And if it does not prove this, it will not prove that the act by which you make a Schiſm ſinful in it ſelf, does not do any ſuch thing though you are perſwaded it does not. Though a mans doubtfulneſs of the lawfulneſs of an action ſo long as the reaſons of it preponderate and weigh down the reaſons that tend to his ſatisfaction, make it unlawful for him to do it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe circumſtances: yet this will not free him from ſin in caſe he be in an error in being ſo perſwaded, but he remains guilty of that error, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51946:75"/>is acceſſary alſo unto the evil that is cauſed thereby. If mens ignorance and unreſolvedneſs in what is their duty, were a protection to them from ſin-guiltineſs though in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, it would be an inducement to them to indulge themſelves in their ignorance and irreſolution. But when a man does not know but that he is in ſuch a <hi>dilemma,</hi> as that he ſins whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he act or forbear to act, either in acting againſt his Conſcience, or in neglecting his duty through error of Conſcience, it will then awaken a man that deſires to keep a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, both towards God and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, to uſe both diligence and impartiality in his enquiry after what is his duty indeed.</p>
               <p>It is I think but needful upon this occaſion to caution many among you againſt an <hi>affected</hi> ſcrupuloſity. I call that an affected ſcrupuloſity, when people love to be ſcrupulous about ſome things, when they are far from it in other things, wherein they have more reaſon to be ſcrupulous. As
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51946:75"/>when they are nice, curious, and ſqueamiſh about undetermined cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in forms of adminiſtration of holy things, but do not at all, or nothing ſo much ſcruple the laying waſte the peace of the Church, and the grieving and hurting others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, nor to lay Government it ſelf low, nor to ſpeak evil freely enough of them that differ from them, and the like, not to mention what is of more private concern. That ſuch things are abroad is too apparent to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied: but whence they proceed, is not perhaps ſo eaſily perceived. Only this is viſible, that perſons ſcrupulouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs about conforming to publick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, hath obtained them among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the reputation of the ſtricter ſort of profeſſors: And from thence it's poſſible they may fanſie themſelves to be of more tender Conſciences than others, and think it may be a good ſign of the truth of grace in them; and upon that account, and of being thought to be ſuch by others, they may affect ſuch a ſcrupuloſity. But
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51946:76"/>ſuch as are thus unequal in their ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling of things, may do well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that ſuch ſcrupuloſity is a more ſure ſign of hypocriſie than of a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſcience, or of the truth of grace, in whomſoever it is found, as ſymbolizing with the Phariſees, who ſtrained at gnats, and yet could ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Camels. Whereas a tenderneſs of Conſcience of the right kind, will make a man as much afraid of erring on the right hand as on the left; which temper is in Scripture given as the Character of a good man, a man that turns not aſide to the right hand nor to the left, but is the upright man. Though tenderneſs of Conſcience is a right good thing if you underſtand thereby a fear of tranſgreſſing any known rule of duty, in one thing as well as another, in conjunction with a careful endeavour to know his rule in every thing, yet ſcrupuloſity which is a fear of offending in that which a man does not know is forbidden, is not ſuch a commendable thing as that men ſhould be in love with it, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51946:76"/>it in themſelves, but is rather proper to thoſe who are ſuperſtitious than to the truly religious. Becauſe it proceeds generally from the falſe Doctrine of men, and from a wrong notion of things, rather than from the obſcurity of the rule of duty. I'ts no marvel if there be no end of ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples with them who believe that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done in faith, eſpecially in the external adminiſtration of Gods worſhip, but what they can bring a Divine Command or Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for, there being none of them that ſo teach, but practiſe otherwiſe, as you may ſoon perceive if you try all particular circumſtances in their worſhip or adminiſtration of holy things, and muſt do ſo, unleſs they will confine themſelves to the very words of the Lords Prayer, and to the form of words preſcribed in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>There are but two ways of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods mind concerning our duty, Natural light and ſupernatural Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And whatever we are not
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51946:77"/>confined to by Divine determination, or reſtrained from by Divine prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition in one of theſe ways, we may ſecurely and without any ſcruple do, when we are thereunto called by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Maſters, Magiſtrates, or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Governours. That which is not againſt us is for us in this caſe, as our Saviour alſo ſaid in another caſe. The Rule of that which is our duty indeed, is doubtleſs very plain: and it would be a reproach to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſs of God to think otherwiſe: <hi>He hath ſhewed thee O man what is good,</hi> ſaith the Prophet. It is mens additions to Gods word, and their teaching that, as commanded or forbidden by God, which he hath not commanded and which he hath not forbidden, that is the true cauſe of our diſtractions. If men would but keep cloſe to what God hath plainly determined, and follow the reaſon of their Governours in other things which are undetermined, and their own beſt reaſon where they are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to do it; there would be little
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51946:77"/>room for mens ſcrupuloſity, or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of diviſions in point of practice. And yet this is nothing but what the Scripture calls for when it directs and enjoins Children to obey their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Servants their Maſters, Subjects their Princes, and that <hi>in all things, only in the Lord,</hi> or wherein they are not countermanded by him.</p>
               <p>Now concerning that other Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein is aſſerted, That when that is impoſed as a condition of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which ought not to be made a condition, if Schiſm be occaſioned thereby, the guilt of it lies only on the impoſers, and not on them upon whom it is impoſed, I anſwer; As to matter of fact it is true, that more may, and ſometimes is made the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Communion, than is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. And when it is ſo, it uſually becomes a temptation to more or leſs to run into Schiſm; and it likewiſe furniſheth ſuch with ſome pretence to draw Diſciples to themſelves, who are ambitions of Heading a Party. In which reſpects it may be matter of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51946:78"/>great Prudence in order to the Churches Peace and Unity, to make no more than is neceſſary, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Communion. But although more ſhould be impoſed as the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Communion than is neceſſary, yet if it be not ſo much more as makes it ſinful to hold Communion on thoſe terms, Then they muſt needs be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſin of Schiſm, who ſeparate upon account of ſuch an impoſition. And the reaſon is, becauſe ſuch a Schiſm is without ſufficient cauſe or juſt ground: which juſt ground is, when one cannot do otherwiſe than ſeparate, without a neceſſity of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Things may be ill impoſed, as when they are inadequate to their end; and yet well obſerved by them on whom they are impoſed, as when not ſinful in themſelves, and when by that means they and the Church ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer leſs in point of inconvenience, and enjoy a greater benefit in preſerving Peace in the Church, than could be obtained in a way of oppoſition. If we ſhould allow a liberty, much more
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51946:78"/>if we hold it a duty for inferiours under Government, to oppoſe and withſtand the Commands of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, as oft as they think they Command things inconvenient, though they ſhould think right, ſo long as they do not Command things which they know to be unlawful for them to obſerve, we ſhould ſoon bring intolerable confuſion into Church and Common-wealth, into Families and all Communities of men where Government is exerciſed. Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies in ſuch caſes muſt be yielded to, rather than greater miſchiefs drawn on us and on the Community by not yielding.</p>
               <p>But you, at leaſt many of you think, that it is an <hi>infringing</hi> of your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty, for men to determine and impoſe upon you, where God hath not determined and impoſed: and that in ſuch caſes it would be a betraying of that liberty, ſhould you not withſtand ſuch impoſitions. To which I anſwer, that thus far 'tis true, that when any thing is impoſed by
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51946:79"/>men under the notion of being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God, of Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or of neceſſity to Salvation, which is not ſo; as this would be a teaching for Doctrines, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of men, ſo a yielding to them ſo impoſed, would be a betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Chriſtian liberty; and more than ſo, it would be a betraying of the Prerogative of our Lord unto the uſurpation of men, and a making to our ſelves other Maſters than Chriſt, and our ſelves ſervants of men in the prohibited ſenſe, and all contrary to the expreſs Doctrine of our Saviour and his Apoſtles. But though this be the caſe in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in many things, and in ſome reſpects among your ſelves alſo: yet this is not the caſe touching the things in diſpute between you and the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The things impoſed, at which you moſt ſtick, are not at all impoſed under the notion of Divine right, but only upon a prudential ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, being things mutable in their nature, and alterable at the pleaſure
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51946:79"/>of them who impoſe them, and are ſo declared in the Preface before the Book of Common Prayer. So that your Conſcience is not impoſed upon to take the things themſelves for any other than they are in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things left undetermined by God one way or other.</p>
               <p>But then there is a ſenſe in which it is not true, that our Chriſtian liberty is unduly infringed by the impoſition of men, although we were at liberty to do or not to do the things enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, before ſuch an impoſition was laid upon us. Our Chriſtian liberty does not exempt us from the duty of obedience to our Superiors in things which in their own nature are but indifferent, and out of ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might be done or let alone. The ſame Divine authority which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins us to call no man on Earth Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, nor to be ſervants of men, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins Children alſo to obey their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Servants their Maſters, Church-members their Spiritual Guides and Governours, and Subjects their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:51946:80"/>and that in all things in which they ſhall not diſobey God in doing contrary to his Commands. So that when things indifferent or undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by God, are impoſed by our Governours, Domeſtick, Politick, or Eccleſiaſtick, only as their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; our Chriſtian liberty is no bar nor plea againſt them. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pretends that it is, draws too near the wicked Gnoſticks, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended exemption from being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and governed by men, by their being Chriſts freemen. Againſt which abuſe of Chriſtian liberty St. <hi>Peter</hi> cautioned the Chriſtians then. For after he had exhorted them to ſubmit themſelves to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14. he preſently adds in <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>as free, and not uſing your liberty as a cloke of maliciouſneſs;</hi> not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Chriſtian liberty to cover their diſaffection to Government, as the Gnoſticks did.</p>
               <p>Our Chriſtian liberty is ſo far from being a bar to our Obedience to our
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:51946:80"/>Governours in all things not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ordered by God, as that it is a great accommodation to us in yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedience to them without ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Conſcience. For when circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the external adminiſtration of holy things, are left ſo much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined by God as they are, we are at the greater liberty to yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the prudential determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Governours, either one way or other, ſo long as they do not determine any thing againſt what God hath determined. In things even of this nature we are to be ſubject to our Governours for Conſcience ſake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.5. that is, out of Conſcience to God who commands our obedience to our Governours, but not out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to the things commanded by them, as if by any inherent holineſs in them our Conſciences were inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto them. And here lies the difference between ſuperſtition, and lawful obedience to authority.</p>
               <p>In the Caſe of Superſtition, the act is done out of Conſcience to the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51946:81"/>thing done, as if ſacred, though but indifferent in its own nature. But in the caſe of lawful obedience in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things, the ſame act is done out of Conſcience to God, not as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the thing, but as command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my obedience to him in all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things, who commands me to do it, and commands it under no other notion but as a thing indifferent in its own nature, and not made ſacred by any command or inſtitution of God. Let me ſay this further to you: There is more of real Religion and true Chriſtianity, in thus obeying the lawful Commands of our Governours, out of Conſcience to God who would have it ſo, than I fear is well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: and more of Irreligion, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſs, and Hypocriſie, in ſlighting Gods expreſs command in this, while we ſeem ſo very fearful and ſcrupulous to offend him in other things, where there is no ſuch danger, nor concerning which we have no ſuch expreſs Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Gods will. If we would but yield obedience to our publick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51946:81"/>in ſuch ſort as Servants are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to do to their Maſters, in ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, fearing God, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we do therein doing it heartily as to the Lord &amp; not unto man, we ſhould therein ſerve the Lord Chriſt, and to better purpoſe than by many things on which greater ſtreſs is laid, and be as capable of <hi>the reward of the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance</hi> thereby, as by any other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip we give him, or ſervice we do him. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.22, 23, 24. I doubt it is not well conſidered what diſſervice is done to Religion when ſo much more than needs is pretended from it to trouble and diſturb Government, and make men fickle and uncertain in their obedience to authority. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the way to make the great men of the Earth hearty Friends to the Chriſtian Cauſe (and when they are ſo, it's much to its advantage) is to give them the experience of its good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in making the moſt ſincere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it, more hearty, forward, and conſtant in their obedience to them againſt all temptations to the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51946:82"/>contrary, than any other men. Which is one reaſon as I am apt to think, why this duty of obedience to Governours is ſo much inculcated on the minds of Chriſtians in the New Teſtament as it is, and why ſo black a brand is ſet on them that <hi>deſpiſe Government or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,</hi> and <hi>ſpeak evil of Dignities,</hi> as is in the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude.</hi>

            <div type="part">
               <p>I Cannot but think it a bad thing and of dangerous conſequence, for you to ſtrain things too far in making that in it ſelf neceſſary to Church Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, which either is not at all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or but only <hi>conveniently</hi> neceſſary under ſome circumſtances: &amp; ſo in like manner in laying too great a ſtreſs on this or that mode of adminiſtration, to the excluſion of others not unlawful. For when you make thoſe things as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to Communion as if they were peremptorily commanded by God, which yet are left to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſtians to uſe, or others in their ſtead as circumſtances in the caſe ſhall direct; You then both tranſgreſs
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51946:82"/>againſt the Laws of <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> and make your ſelves guilty of <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.</hi> And upon this very ſcore, I fear there is much more of ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among you, than you have any cauſe to ſuſpect in the Parochial way. For thoſe things at which you are moſt offended, in the Pariſh way, are not at all uſed or required to be uſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of their being enjoined by God, but only as things which may be uſed, or others in the ſtead of them, if our Governours pleaſed and thought it more convenient, as was ſaid before. Whereas you placing Religion in refuſing thoſe things, which as they are not commanded, ſo neither are they forbidden by God, as fearing you ſhould diſpleaſe him if you ſhould uſe them, do therein plainly act a part of <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> while others who uſe them but only as they are, not placing any Religion in them at all, are altogether free from, whom yet you are ready cauſleſly to charge with it. For ſuperſtition as it is an <hi>exceſs of fear,</hi> conſiſts as much if not
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51946:83"/>more, <hi>in refuſing and rejecting things as forbidden by God which are not,</hi> as it doth in uſing things as commanded by him which are not. <hi>Touch not, taſt not, handle not, were doctrines of ſuperſtition (Col.</hi> 2.) as well as that of the Phariſees, in requiring waſhing before eating as a piece of Religion, an action otherwiſe in it ſelf not unlawful.</p>
               <p>Beſides, when you place Religion ſo much as you do in this or that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal form and way, when perhaps neither that nor another which differs from it, is at all made neceſſary by God to the excluſion of the other, but that either the one, or the other, or a third, may competently anſwer the end for which external modes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſerve and are appointed, which is for the adminiſtring the ſubſtance of that worſhip which is determined and appointed by God: I ſay, when you do thus place ſo much of Religion in one to the excluſion of the reſt, it becomes a dangerous ſnare to many people to place their Religion much, and ſometimes moſtly in that form
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51946:83"/>and way, and to think themſelves bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſtians than thoſe of another form, though thoſe other do not at all place their Religion in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal form they uſe, but in the ſpiritual ſubſtance to which the form is but as the clothing, and may be ſhifted and varied as occaſion requires. There is neither the one form nor the other, but that Chriſtians may be very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately devout and ſerious in their addreſſes to God by it, if the fault be not their own, if they do not by their own prejudice againſt it, or by careleſsneſs in uſing it, deprive themſelves of being ſo: this ſome that have had experience of both know. And it is not the uſe of the beſt form, whatever it is, will avail a man to make him inwardly in Soul devout towards God, unleſs his mind exerciſe it ſelf about the ſpiritual matter and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the worſhip it ſelf. And they that reſt in the form, be it what it will be, and ſatisfie themſelves only with uſing it, do but preſent God with the skin of the Sacrifice, inſtead of the Sacrifice it ſelf.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:51946:84"/>
               <p>AND now I have uttered my mind thus freely unto you, I ſhould be very ſorry if it ſhould produce no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter effect than only to make your minds the more uneaſie in your way, when as it was deſigned as a help to bring you to that eaſe of mind which is the effect of true repentance. I have ſo much reſpect for many of you whom I know, as will make me very far from doing any thing to grieve you, otherwiſe than that you might be grieved <hi>after a godly manner,</hi> and to your advantage; after which way, and for which end, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſometime wrote to them who were very dear to him. I am, I aſſure you, ſo far from being gratified in my own mind by any inconvenience you ſuſtain by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of your differing thoughts and way, and ſo far from deſigning any increaſe of trouble to you by dealing thus plainly and openly with you as I have done, as that for your ſakes I ſhould be very glad if our Governours ſhould be inclined out of compaſſion
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51946:84"/>to you, to make the terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ſomewhat eaſier for you.</p>
               <p>I do not indeed expect that you ſhould be perſwaded by any thing I ſay, as they are my words. But I do expect, as well I may, that you ſhould ſo much regard the concernment of your own account to God, and of the welfare of his Church, and of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that you ſhould conſider, and that ſeriouſly, the <hi>reaſon</hi> of what I have laid before you. I dare not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be over confident of any great ſucceſs in this Addreſs, when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how little the endeavours of others have had which have been of ſomewhat a like nature. But this diffidence proceeds not at all from any ſuſpicion I have touching the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the reaſon and argument which is offered to perſwade you by, but from the <hi>rootedneſs</hi> and ſtrength of your <hi>prejudice,</hi> by which the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reaſoning is many times reſiſted. <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith (<hi>Job</hi> 34.) <hi>that the ear try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth words as the mouth taſteth meat.</hi> Now we know that that meat which
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51946:85"/>is good and ſavoury in it ſelf, and pleaſant to the taſt of thoſe who are in a healthful habit of body, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury and perhaps nauſeous to thoſe of a vitiated palate. And there is juſt a like difference between the taſt which men have of the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, upon the account of the corruption and uncorruptneſs of their Judgments. And therefore it will be your wiſdom in order to your ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a right Judgment, to diveſt your mind as much as poſſible you can of all prejudice, when you come to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe diſcourſes of this nature.</p>
               <p>Some I underſtand have taken up a prejudice againſt ſomewhat I have done formerly of this Nature, from a miſtake and miſinformation, as if the turn of times had cauſed that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration which hath been made in my mind about the things diſcuſſed in this Addreſs. But to the end that none may be taken off from peruſing and conſidering this diſcourſe upon any ſuch pretence, they may certainly know the untruth of ſuch ſuggeſtions
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51946:85"/>by this, to wit, that I publiſhed my <hi>Retractation of ſeparation,</hi> in the year 1659. when ſeparation was in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt repute, and the turn of times they ſpeak of then out of proſpect to ſuch as my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> counted it but a ſmall thing with him to be judged by men, or of mans Judgment, becauſe he was to ſtand or fall not by their Judgment but by Gods. And conſidering that every one of us may ſay as he did in this; it very much concerns us in our enquiry, what is, and what is not to be done and practiſed by us, not much to mind what this or the other party will think or ſay of us, or whether this or that way will beſt accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date us in our Worldly intereſt, but with uprightneſs to do all as unto God in the ſight of God, to whom every one of us muſt give an account for himſelf. And becauſe we muſt do ſo, therefore we ſhould take as little as may be upon truſt, no not from thoſe we have the beſt eſteem of, but every one to try his own work, that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:51946:86"/>ſo he <hi>may have rejoycing in himſelf and not in another,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. And becauſe there are not many that are willing to be at the pains to put themſelves into a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of doing ſo in things controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among us: Therefore it greatly concerns you who are Leaders of the people, to be very diligent and very faithful in trying the grounds on which you now go in ways ſo much differing as they do from all in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that have gone before you, yea even from the old Non-Conformiſts themſelves: And if you have any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions or miſgivings, touching the unſafeneſs or unaccountableneſs of the way in which you conduct the people, let no Worldly intereſt or fear of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing or of loſing them, prevail upon you to conceal it from them, but truſt God in dealing faithfully, which will both bring inward peace and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and intereſt you in his ſpecial care.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>I Will add one thing more, and that is to put you upon conſidering, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51946:86"/>by this Dividing way in which you are, you either have or are ever like to promote the <hi>Power of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> among us in this Nation, as you might have done, if you had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Communion in the Parochial way as heretofore. For I freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to you, that I vehemently ſuſpect that you neither have nor are like to do it ſo well in the way you take, as you might in that. The power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion I conceive does very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, not in external modes of worſhip, or in a zealous crying up one, and crying down another, but in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the mind, and inward and profound devotion of Soul to God in reference to the ſpiritual ſubſtance of his worſhip, whether in this form or that: and in our being like to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in humility, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, gentleneſs, peaceableneſs, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Charity in ſeeking the good of all men by word and deed: in a patient bearing of unkind uſage from men without expreſſing any bitterneſs of ſpirit towards them for it, by word
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51946:87"/>or deed, but rather returning them good for evil, and the like. But now diviſion in Churches, making of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, rending and tearing and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, hath quite another tendency than to promote theſe things. It tends to diſcompoſe the ſpirits of men in their reverend and awful approaches to God in the duties of his worſhip, to imbitter their ſpirits one againſt another, ſo that it becomes far more difficult than otherwiſe it would be, <hi>to lift up holy hands without wrath and doubting.</hi> It tends to fill the minds of men with uncharitable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of, and uncharitable affections to one another, and to exaſperate their ſpirits one againſt another: It tends to the deſpiſing and contemning one another, and to a proud and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful magnifying of one party a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another; to a ſwelling and grudging one againſt another: It tends to whiſpering, backbiting, and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, and to miniſter provocation and evil ſpeaking one againſt another. And theſe things are the oppoſites to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:51946:87"/>the power of Religion, and if you will believe St. <hi>James,</hi> tend to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it and to introduce an ill ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Religion in the room of it. <hi>For where envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion and every evil work. Jam.</hi> 3.16. Theſe things which are the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fruits of Schiſm, are ſo like the fruits of thoſe who are deſcribed to have a form of godlineſs without the power of it, as may well drive you from the Schiſm which you have made, only for a form ſake. I would we had not too much experience of the truth of what I ſay, to need any proof from Scripture. However I will give you St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Judgment in the Caſe.</p>
               <p>I have told you before that the Schiſm in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> when St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to them, had not proceeded to any ſuch height as to break the Church in pieces by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and diſclaiming Communion one with another; and yet upon the ſingle account of their diviſions and the effects of them, <hi>they were yet
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51946:88"/>but carnal and walked as men,</hi> as he tells them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. although otherwiſe they were <hi>in every thing inriched, in all utterance and in all knowledge, coming behind in no gift. Chap.</hi> 1.5.7. And upon this very account <hi>their coming together,</hi> their ſolemn meetings for divine worſhip, <hi>were not for the better but for the worſe,</hi> did not only keep them from growing, but ſet them backward, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.17, 18. And then by what he ſays, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.6. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.20. we may ſee what the fruits and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of their Schiſm were which made them ſocarnal in the Apoſtles account; ſuch as were their being <hi>puft up for one Teacher againſt another,</hi> and their <hi>debates, envyings, wraths, ſtrifes, backbitings, whiſperings, ſwellings, and tumults,</hi> that were among them. Juſt ſuch as your Schiſm hath brought forth among us in this Nation: only I fear the effects of our Schiſm hath as much exceeded theirs then, as our Schiſm it ſelf hath exceeded theirs. And if theſe things have been, are, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51946:88"/>will be the natural effects of Schiſm, which are ſo directly contrary and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the power of Religion; Then you will do well calmly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether you have not miſtaken the right method of promoting the power of Religion when you made ſo wide a breach as you have done in the Church to effect it.</p>
               <p>If inſtead of this, each Chriſtian of you had kept to Parochial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and each <hi>outed</hi> Miniſter had kept their reſidence among them and Communion with them as private Members in the Pariſh way, and had alſo in a private capacity joined with thoſe Miniſters which have ſucceeded them, in doing all the good they could in the Pariſh; as by a private application and improvement of the publick labours of their Miniſter, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Catechiſing and other perſonal inſtruction and exhortation privately adminiſtred to the ſeveral Families in the Pariſh: I ſay if ſuch a thing as this had been done inſtead of gathering ſeparate Congregations, I
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51946:89"/>nothing doubt but that by ſo doing, you would have taken an unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly far better courſe to promote the power of Religion in the Nation, than by what you have done, and to have procured a removal alſo of your burdens long before now, and to have been competently provided for in the mean time. But ſeparation hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of old been counted an undue, irregular and dangerous way of ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what you deſire, even by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Non Conformiſts themſelves, and was as much inveighed againſt by them in thoſe times, as it was by the Conformiſts themſelves.</p>
               <p>You know right well that when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing, obſervation of Sabbaths and other inſtituted parts of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, came in competition with mercy, Charity, and the like, it by no means pleaſed him when theſe were thruſt out that the other might take place. Much leſs have you reaſon to think that he is in ſuch love as you are with one external manner and form of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of worſhip when another
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51946:89"/>may be uſed, as that he would have that contended for to the loſs of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Peace, and Unity, when as he hath commanded us <hi>above all things to put on charity, Col.</hi> 3.14. <hi>and above all things to have fervent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity among our ſelves,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8. and that <hi>peace ſhould rule, Col.</hi> 3.15. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to think that God is in ſuch love with one form above another, under ſuch circumſtances, cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed but from a miſapprehenſion of the nature of God, and the nature of his worſhip.</p>
               <p>If this then be true (and I cannot ſee how it can be denied but) that your ſeparation, as all unlawful ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Church is, be of ſuch ill abode to the power of Religion as I have ſhewed; Then if you be in any meaſure convinced that it is ſo, I hope it will not be grievous to any of you to whom the Commandments of God are not grievous, to make a ſtand, and bethink you, how you may take your ſelves off this way. And if the Higher Powers over us ſhall perceive any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51946:90"/>in you for what hath been done, I dare not ſuſpect but that they will take your Caſe into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate conſideration, and be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do their part towards the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the great breach that hath been made in the Church, and in a healing way to hinder the growing miſchiefs of it. Which God of his infinite mercy grant before it be too late.</p>
               <p>That which hath occaſioned all this unhappineſs under which the Church of God among us groans, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the moſt ſpiritual and moſt concerning part of it extreamly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, is a want of a right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and due uſe of our <hi>Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</hi> It was that which occaſioned diviſions and the unchriſtian effects of them in the Churches firſt planted by the Apoſtles. And the ſame thing hath produced the ſame and perhaps much worſe effects among us in this Nation. Very many of the Jews who believed, did not at the firſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their Chriſtian liberty, but
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51946:90"/>thought themſelves ſtill under the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of the Ritual Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> But others did, eſpecially the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Gentiles. And the want of a knowledge of it in the one, and the want of a due uſe of it in the other, begot an unchriſtian carriage in them one towards another. Upon occaſion of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Brethren, you have been called unto liberty; only uſe not liberty as an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the fleſh, but by love ſerve one another.</hi> When he ſaith ye have been called unto liberty, his meaning doubtleſs in ſpecial was, that by the Chriſtian Ecconomy the believers were ſet at liberty from being tyed to the obſervation of a great variety of external modes and forms of worſhip to which the Jews by the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> were obliged. But though they were at liberty in theſe, yet they were ſtill as ſtrictly obliged to the ſpirit and moral ſubſtance of the Law as ever, one part whereof conſiſting in our love one to another, according to the Apoſtles words in the next
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51946:91"/>Verſe, where he ſaith; <hi>for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> Now his counſel therefore to them was, that they would uſe this liberty of theirs ſo, as that in the uſe of it they might <hi>ſerve one another in love,</hi> that they would ſuffer Chriſtian Charity to govern them in the uſe of their Chriſtian liberty, and not to do any thing to the prejudice of that. And then cautions them that by no means they ſhould <hi>uſe this liberty as an occaſion to the fleſh,</hi> by gratifying any carnal ſelfiſh humour under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Chriſtian liberty, to the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing or quenching love, or to the ingendering <hi>variance, emulations, wrath, ſtrife, envying,</hi> or the like, which are part of the works of the fleſh which he after reckons up, <hi>Ver.</hi> 20. And intimates in the 14. <hi>ver.</hi> that if they did thus abuſe their Chriſtian liberty, what the conſequence of it would be, and that was their <hi>biting one another</hi> firſt, and then their being <hi>conſumed one of another.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:51946:91"/>
               <p>Contrary to which counſel of the Apoſtle, thoſe Chriſtians abuſed their Chriſtian liberty when they put ſuch a ſtreſs on it, and on ſtanding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably in it, without giving any ground to thoſe Chriſtians which did not underſtand it, and in placing ſo much of Chriſtianity in it, as to deſpiſe, ſlight, and ſet at naught thoſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who did not underſtand and uſe it as they did, and that to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as to cauſe diviſion, ſtrife, and uncharitable cenſuring one another; by means whereof their <hi>good,</hi> the good way of Chriſtianity it ſelf, came to be evil ſpoken of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if they had rightly uſed their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty, they would have deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves in not uſing that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though lawful in it ſelf, at ſuch times and in ſuch caſes, when their doing ſo would have amounted to no more than the ſuffering of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal inconvenience, and when their uſing of it apparently tended to a greater and more publick inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or miſchief rather, ſuch as the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:51946:92"/>breaking the Churches Peace and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the bad effects of it, both among themſelves and in reference to them without, in cauſing them to think the worſe of Chriſtianity it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> to avoid the abuſe of his Chriſtian liberty, would as he ſays, <hi>eat no fleſh while the world ſtands, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than by eating it, to make his brother to offend,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13. And that was not all neither; but in caſe the ſuſpending the uſe of his liberty were not enough to ſecure the Peace and Unity of the Church, and what depended thereon, then the ſtrong were to make uſe of their Chriſtian liberty, in complying with the weak in things not in themſelves unlawful, though out of thoſe circumſtances al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together inconvenient, rather than by ſtanding on their Chriſtian liberty, to run the forementioned hazards of diſturbing the Peace of the Church, diminiſhing Charity, cauſing Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the ſtumbling of the weak, and hardening of Adverſaries. And
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51946:92"/>thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſed his Chriſtian libe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rt in complying ſo far as lawfully he might, though ſomething againſt the grane, when circumſtances made it neceſſary for him ſo to do, and that too by the advice of <hi>James and all the Elders at Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 21.23, 24. For he, as he ſays, <hi>became as a Jew to the Jews, and as without law to thoſe without law, (yet in that under the law to Chriſt) yea all things to all men, and all for the Goſpel ſake,</hi> as he ſays, that the Chriſtian Religion might the better get up in the World, and not by a contrary courſe to loſe ground, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.20.23.</p>
               <p>And if we in this Age had been ſo wiſe, and ſo Chriſtian as to have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in uſing our Chriſtian Liberty in a way of lawful complyance, and in forbearing the uſe of it to ſhun a greater inconvenience, Chriſtianity would have had a more lovely and attracting aſpect, and have yielded more ſatisfaction and pleaſure to the minds of the Profeſſors of it, and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51946:93"/>gained more upon others, than by the courſe we have taken we have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to have or to have effected. O that there were but more of this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and temper of St. <hi>Paul</hi> among us, how happy ſhould we be!</p>
               <p>But the want of this, the want of a right underſtanding and due uſe of Chriſtian liberty, hath doubtleſs been the great occaſion of Church Diviſion among us in theſe days, and of the unhappy effects of them, as well as they were of thoſe that fell out in the days of the Apoſtles. There are and have been many people who have not underſtood the latitude of their Chriſtian liberty; and from thence have proceeded many needleſs ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and thoſe needleſs and groundleſs ſcruples, have turned many out of the way of their duty into other ways, ways of ſeparation and oppoſition, and from thence have followed the lamentable effects I have formerly mentioned.</p>
               <p>I ſay many have not underſtood the Latitude of their Chriſtian liberty
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51946:93"/>about the uſing and forbearing to uſe as circumſtances ſhould direct, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral circumſtantial matters in or about the external adminiſtration of Gods worſhip. And this hath been occaſioned very much by ſome <hi>falſe doctrine</hi> which hath been formerly broached by ſome out of an ignorant zeal, and imbibed by many, and is ſtill kept on foot by ſome among us: And that is, <hi>That nothing is to be done in the worſhip of God, which he hath not commanded:</hi> or at leaſt nothing but what is of natural neceſſity, as time and place or the like. And by this means people have been brought to ſcruple Communion in the publick worſhip of God among us, becauſe of ſome circumſtances in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, which are not expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God. And ſome, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves and the people, that this Doctrine of theirs hath been true, have made uſe (ill uſe indeed) of many Scriptures which refer only to the ſubſtance of Gods worſhip, and not to external circumſtances of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51946:94"/>Such for inſtance as forbid adding to, or diminiſhing from the word of God; and ſuch as in a figurative Scheme of ſpeech condemn worſhipping of falſe Gods: as when leſs is ſaid and very much more meant, as when the worſhiping of the Sun and Moon, and mens offering their Children in Sacrifice to <hi>Baal,</hi> to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,</hi> is called the doing of that which God commanded them not, when in truth he had with a high hand for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.31. and 19.5. and 32.35. This manner of ſpeaking is an Hebraiſm not unuſual, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.4. <hi>And choſe that in which I delighted not, Pſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. They have made uſe alſo for their purpoſe, of ſuch Scriptures as have condemned the changing and altering of ſome circumſtances of worſhip which God had by expreſs appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fixed and determined. As the <hi>offering with ſtrange fire</hi> by <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> ſuch-as <hi>God commanded not, Levit.</hi> 10.1. when he had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe expreſly determined, that they
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51946:94"/>ſhould offer with fire <hi>taken from off the altar, Levit.</hi> 16.12. and 6.12, 13. And <hi>Jeroboams keeping the feaſt on the fifteenth day of the eight month, the month which he had deviſed of his own heart,</hi> or a feaſt <hi>like unto the feaſt in Juda;</hi> things contrary to what God had expreſly appointed. And <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zza</hi>'s touching the Ark to guide it in a Cart, when God had expreſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that it ſhould be <hi>born on the Prieſts ſhoulders,</hi> and the like. Theſe things were not only circumſtances not commanded by God, but they were uſed and done to the juſtling out what he had commanded; like the Phariſees making void the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God through their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, that is by thruſting the one out, and bringing the other in their room.</p>
               <p>And if any thing of this nature could be proved to be in our publick worſhip, theſe Scriptures might have been pertinently alledged to condemn it, but not to prove that nothing may be done in the worſhip of God which
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51946:95"/>he hath not commanded. For it's one thing to leave that which God hath commanded undone, and to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of our own deviſing inſtead of it; and another thing to do that which God hath appointed and ſomething more, but not in oppoſition to it, but in purſuance of the ſame end. And thus <hi>Solomon</hi> offered Sacrifice in the middle Court of the Temple, beſides the offering on the brazen Altar, though God had appointed the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Altar only for that purpoſe, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.64. And thus alſo King <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi> with the Princes and People, kept the Feaſt of the Paſsover, not only for ſeven days which was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gods inſtitution, but after that for <hi>ſeven days more alſo,</hi> and yet ſo far as appears, with good approbation from God, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 30.23. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſuper-addition of the Croſs in Baptiſm, with the words Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, were not at firſt made upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of like nature, I cannot ſay, but may be conſidered. And yet again, it's one thing to do a thing in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51946:95"/>of God otherwiſe than he hath appointed when he hath appointed how it ſhall be done, both in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the intrinſick ſubſtance, and external circumſtance; and another thing to do it this way or another, as to the external adminiſtration, when he hath determined only the ſubſtance of worſhip what ſhall be done, and after what manner, as to the ſpiritual part, but hath left it at mens liberty, and undetermined in which of the ways it ſhall be done, as to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward circumſtances of adminiſtration, when there are more ways than one in which it may be done. In the former caſe we are bound up to one way only, in the other we ſin not if we do the thing, either in the one way or the other. Only general rules in this caſe will direct men to chuſe that which appears to them beſt in it ſelf, other circumſtances concurring, and where we are at liberty to uſe that we judge beſt, without ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizing any others, and without making any Schiſm by croſſing ſuch publick
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51946:96"/>orders as are appointed to keep peace and unity in the Church, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what depends upon them.</p>
               <p>Now if there be ſuch a liberty left in the outward adminiſtration of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as I have ſuppoſed, at leaſt in ſome Caſes; then the propoſition can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true, That nothing is to be done in the worſhip of God which he hath not commanded. And that there is ſuch a liberty left will beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by trying the matter in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. I will inſtance in that of Prayer, which is an eminent part of Gods worſhip. The ſubſtance of this piece of divine worſhip, God hath expreſly determined, as that we pray to him, and in the name of his Son Chriſt Jeſus, and for things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his will, neceſſary or lawful, and with ſeriouſneſs and devotion of Soul, in Faith and with fervency. But he hath no where told us that this ſhall be done without any ſixed form or method, or without being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced out of a Book, or that it ſhall be done only according to the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51946:96"/>inſtantaneous conception of the mind, both for matter and method. And therefore for any man to pretend that to do it one of theſe ways only, is neceſſary by Divine appointment, and the other diſallowed by the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, is indeed an <hi>adding to Gods word,</hi> or a ſaying he ſaith what he hath not ſaid. So that in truth many in this caſe and upon this account run into ſuperſtition, while they cry out moſt againſt it; and the Teachers of ſuch Doctrine fright the people into <hi>ſuperſtition,</hi> while they pretend to deter and draw them from it. This is a plain caſe, if plain truth would ſatisfie ſuch of you as moſt need it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Geſture</hi> in Prayer, ſuch as is kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lifting up hands and eyes, and the like, are as well ſigns and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of inward devotion and means to excite it, as words are, and as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally circumſtantial parts of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mode of worſhip. And yet I am confident you do not believe but that God hath left a liberty of choice in theſe, as circumſtances ſhall direct.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51946:97"/>And if that Doctrine were true, that nothing is to be done in the external mode of Gods worſhip but what he hath commanded, I vehemently ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that upon your utmoſt enquiry into what is commanded in the New Teſtament, in reference to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal manner of Prayer, that you would find your ſelves confined only to the uſe of the Lords Prayer, by that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.2. <hi>When ye pray, ſay, Our father, &amp;c.</hi> For I do not find any command in the New Teſtament but this, as to the external manner of Prayer. For when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9. at a time and on occaſion different from that mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> ſaith, <hi>after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner therefore pray ye, Our father, &amp;c.</hi> I reckon that herein he gave direction touching the matter and order of Prayer, but not at all how this matter ſhould be uttered and expreſt to God, further than in the form here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Though on the other hand I am far from thinking that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our thereby intended to limit his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51946:97"/>to thoſe words only. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a liberty to uſe other words in expreſſing the ſame matter, ſeems to be thereby granted, yet in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, it is not ſaid, as whether in a ſixed form or otherwiſe. So that a liberty is ſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The like is true concerning other parts of Gods worſhip, as the two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, Baptiſm and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and alſo of ſinging of Pſalms. Although there is a command for the ſubſtance of theſe, yet there is no command for ſeveral circumſtances conveniently neceſſary about the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration and uſe of theſe, and without which the ſubſtance cannot be adminiſtred, but a latitude is left therein, ſo that reſpect be but had unto general rules of edification, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, decency, and peace; and that things of leſs moment be under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul and government of greater. In all which much is and muſt be left to the prudence of thoſe into whoſe

So that if nothing be done to the corrupting of the ſubſtance of worſhip expreſly determined, nor to the juſtling out any thing relating to it which is determined and ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had reſolved to build a Temple for the ſame ends for which a Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle by Gods appointment had been built, God told him that he <hi>did well in that it was in his heart to do it</hi> (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.18.) even then when he
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51946:98"/>told him alſo, that he had never ſaid to any of the Tribes or Judges of his people, <hi>why build ye not me an houſe of Cedar?</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.7.

                     <hi>Myſt. of Iniq. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded p.</hi> 133, 134, 135.</note> Many more inſtances of this nature are elſewhere taken notice of out of the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, in which times things relating to the external admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Gods worſhip, were far more minutely determined by God, than they are in the New.</p>
               <p>Now the caſe under conſideration being thus, thoſe who firſt broached and thoſe who have ſince abetted this Doctrine that aſſerts nothing to be lawful in the worſhip of God which he hath not commanded, when they extend it farther than to the ſubſtance of worſhip, have corrupted or rather gone about to overthrow the Doctrine of Chriſtian liberty in great part. And they have thereby hid from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples eyes the liberty left them by Chriſt in theſe matters, and filled their minds with endleſs ſcruples, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them into unlawful Schiſms. If
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51946:99"/>thoſe formerly, or more lately, who deſired ſome alteration in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal form of adminiſtration uſed in our Church, had not run ſo high as to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert things unlawful, which by all their <hi>Mediums</hi> they could never prove to be ſo, but had peaceably and modeſtly purſued their deſires from time to time only upon account of the inconveniency of ſome things as apprehended by them, and had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied themſelves, that in doing ſo, they had gone as far as in duty they were bound, without ever rending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Communion with the Church, or diſturbing the peace of it by unſetling the peoples minds, and filling their heads with Jealouſies, and their Conſciences with ſcruples; they would without doubt have taken a more ſafe and Chriſtian, a more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and probable way to have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their deſires in time, than by that courſe by which they have expoſed the Church and Religion to unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſadvantages, they have done. And therefore after tryal of other ways, to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51946:99"/>come now to this at laſt, will doubtleſs be a more honourable and Chriſtian courſe, and more prudential as to all worthy ends, both in reference to the honour of Religion, and its influence upon mens hearts and lives, the peace of the Nation, the compoſing of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples diſtracted minds, the reducing of the erroneous, the fruſtration of the deſigns of adverſaries, and the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Chriſtian liberty to its right uſe.</p>
               <p>For I have ſhewed before that men then uſe their Chriſtian liberty beſt, when they can and do act in ways though but only lawful, when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of Chriſtians, and the intereſt of Religion in the main in the World, calls for it, though otherwiſe and in ſome reſpects not pleaſing to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And ſo did St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſo he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted others to do when he ſaid, <hi>give no offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God: even as I pleaſe all men in all things, not ſeeking my own profit but the profit of many, that they may be ſaved,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32, 33. And again, <hi>let no man ſeek
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:51946:100"/>his own, but every man anothers wealth, ver.</hi> 24. And again, <hi>we then that are ſtrong, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not pleaſe our ſelves. Let every one pleaſe his neighbour for his good to edification: for Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo pleaſed not himſelf, &amp;c. Ro.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3. And again, <hi>look not every man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of others, Phil.</hi> 2.4. And again, <hi>I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means ſave ſome, and this I do for the Goſpel ſake,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.22, 23.</p>
               <p>And if ever you would follow him both in his Doctrine and example, you muſt certainly alter your courſe. For I cannot imagine when I ſee how far St. <hi>Paul</hi> denied himſelf in his own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in things not otherwiſe accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him, and perſwaded others to do ſo likewiſe rather than breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſhould be made or continue in the Church, and Charity be thruſt out: and rather than Jews or Gentiles without, or in the Church, ſhould be ſcandalized againſt the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: I ſay when I conſider this, I
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:51946:100"/>cannot imagine but that if he had been in your circumſtances, but that he would have yielded to have done any thing not ſinful in it ſelf, and every whit as much as you need to do, to have prevented or removed ſuch manifold and intolerable evils as Schiſm hath brought upon us.</p>
               <p>You may and do perhaps think that if things relating to the external adminiſtration of Gods Ordinances and worſhip, are, at leaſt in great part, left ſo much undetermined and at liberty, to chuſe this or that as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſhall direct, as I have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted they are: then why ſhould you be reſtrained from making uſe of that which you apprehend to be the beſt? There is no doubt but that this may be done, this liberty be uſed, when other mens good or hurt is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it. But when my forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to uſe this liberty will tend to the publick good, and my uſing of it to a publick hurt (which is plainly the caſe before us) then I ſhould not act like ſuch a Chriſtian as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was, if
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:51946:101"/>under theſe circumſtances I ſhould uſe that liberty which out of them I might freely uſe. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>all things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for me, but all things edifie not: all things are lawfull for me, but I will not brought under the power of any,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.12. and 10.23. His meaning I doubt not is, that though thoſe things which he ſpeaks of, were in themſelves ſimply conſidered law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſuch as to which he had an affection alſo, yet he reſolved this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, that he would not be brought under the power of them, but would hold and keep himſelf at liberty to uſe his liberty one way or another, according as it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with, or tend to the publick good, or to forbear to uſe it when it tended to the contrary. Now I have repreſented to you before in part, how many, great, and lamentable, the evils are, which are brought on this Church and Nation, by your aſſuming the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty you uſe under the preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:51946:101"/>in which you are. And therefore methinks if you can but tell how to reconcile your ſelves unto St. <hi>Pauls</hi> mind and reſolution, you ſhould quickly and without any great heſitation, deſiſt and put a ſtop to your preſent proceeding, and return to Parochial Communion.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <p>I Hope you do not think that the intereſt of Religion in the Souls and lives of men, is more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged than damnified in the total ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count by your dividing: or that it would at all have loſt in the general account of profit and loſs, in caſe it never had been begun ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. If you do, I acknowledge my ſelf herein to differ from you: unleſs you eſtimate mens religiouſneſs by their zeal for and againſt outward modes and forms and opinions in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and for and againſt parties, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on account of thoſe forms and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; and not by their ſober and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:51946:102"/>ſerious piety, modeſty, humility, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, Juſtice and Charity, together with their Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: which are the things by which I meaſure mens religiouſneſs. And I appeal to all ſuch among you as are in a like capacity with my ſelf in point of age and experience in this matter, to make a Judgment of this Nature; whether there be not juſt cauſe to fear that Religion hath loſt ground among us upon the account of our diviſions, ſo as it never would have done if they never had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun: beſides the hazard we run of expoſing our poſterities to loſe the ſubſtance by our contending for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance: and beſides the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we have thereby put upon men to call the whole of Chriſtianity into queſtion, and thereupon to give reins to their luſts more than ever before ſince the Reformation was firſt made. I pray God ſo to bind the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe things upon your minds, that you may be awakened thereby, out of I know not what dream into
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:51946:102"/>which a great many of the good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Nation have fallen.</p>
               <p>There is nothing hardly in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity more evident than that matters of leſs moment are to give way to thoſe of greater, circumſtance to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, conveniencies to neceſſaries, a leſs convenience to a greater, a greater inconveniency to a leſs, duties only by Poſitive Inſtitution, to thoſe which are morally or naturally ſuch; as might be ſhewed in many other Scriptures,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.4, 5, 6, 7.</note> beſides thoſe now touch'd on about Chriſtian liberty. And I think nothing gives a more direct contradiction to all this, than the Schiſm that is made among us, or the things by which it is made: becauſe by this you make matters of greater moment to truckle and yield to thoſe that are leſs, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to ſubſtance, matters ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to thoſe of conveniency, a greater convenience to a leſs, and ſo on. For I appeal to the light of your own reaſon, and to your Conſcience, whether the affairs of Religion in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51946:103"/>to the Church of God and to the World, are ſo much concerned in having Gods worſhip and Ordinances adminiſtred in your way, rather than in the way of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as they are in the peace and unity of the Church, and in what depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: Whether the Souls of men in general, both of thoſe which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to you, and of thoſe which do not, are advantaged by your way of adminiſtration above what they are and would be in the way of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> more than they are hurt by the diviſion and ſeparation that is made about that difference: Whether the Chriſtian Religion be more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured abroad in other Nations, among Chriſtians and Infidels, by the one, than hurt by the other: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Proteſtant Cauſe both at home and abroad, gains more by the one than it is hurt by the other: and whether more ſecured to poſterity by the one, than endangered by the other: Whether error and hereſie be more ſuppreſt by the one, than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51946:103"/>by the other: and laſtly, whether Charity, Humility, and other Chriſtian vertues or graces, wherein the ſubſtance and power of Religion conſiſts, are farthered in your way above what they are and would be in the way of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> more than they are hindered by Schiſm and ſeparation.</p>
               <p>Now if the affairs and concerns of Religion among men, do in theſe and many other reſpects loſe more by your Schiſm than they get by having the worſhip of God adminiſtred in your way rather than in the way of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as doubtleſs they do, and the thing is too manifeſt to be denied; Then you muſt needs be as certainly guilty of making matters of greater moment to ſtoop and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to thoſe of leſs, as ever the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees were of paſſing over the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier matters of the Law, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves that they tithed Mint, Aniſe, and Cummin.</p>
               <p>There is no ſuch proportion of <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue</hi> in your way of external admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51946:104"/>of holy things, as different from that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as makes it worthy to be put in <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition</hi> with the peace and unity of the Church, and what depends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the Scripture no where lays any ſuch injunction upon us, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve one way or manner of external adminiſtration of the right ſubſtance of worſhip, (ſuppoſing it to be done in common language) as it does for <hi>the keeping of the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace:</hi> nor gives any ſuch caution againſt any external form of adminiſtration, except that which is made in an unknown tongue, as it does againſt the breach of the peace and unity of the Church, and the many conſequent ill effects thereof. Nor is there any ſuch <hi>utility</hi> in your way of adminiſtration, as different from that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as makes it worthy to be put in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with the peace and unity of the Church. I preſume there is no ſober, ſerious Chriſtian among you, will ſay that your way of adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51946:104"/>makes any ſuch difference in the hearts and lives of Chriſtians, but that there were heretofore and are now, Chriſtians in Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as ſober, righteous, and godly, as any among you. I know nothing therein to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a man from being as holy and as good as he hath a mind to be. It is the difference in mens more or leſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance to the ſubſtance of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, that makes them better or worſe Chriſtians, and not their uſing different undetermined circumſtances in the adminiſtration of worſhip.</p>
               <p>And if it be ſo that your way of adminiſtration as different from that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> holds no ſuch proportion of value or utility, as makes it worthy to be brought in competition with the peace and unity of the Church; Then for you to bring it into competition therewith, nay to prefer it above the peace and unity of the Church, and what depends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it is apparent you do, is a thing altogether unaccountable, and a flat
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51946:105"/>contradiction to that vein of Doctrine in the Scripture which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above.</p>
               <p>I know you will be ready enough to ſay, that if it be ſo bad a thing in us to put undetermined circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the adminiſtration of holy things into competition with the peace and unity of the Church, as you ſay it is; Then it cannot be good in them, who by impoſing ſuch things upon us as conditions of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, do put them into competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the peace and unity of the Church alſo, which is divided upon that account.</p>
               <p>There is I grant little queſtion but that the impoſing of nothing as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Communion but what is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally freeſt from exception, is a very good way to preſerve peace and unity in the Church. But yet the uſing of ſome indifferent circumſtances in the worſhip of God upon the firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from Popery in this Nation, was doubtleſs thought as convenient for the bringing people to Church
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51946:105"/>then, as ever a complying with the Jews in their uſages not ſinful in themſelves, was at the firſt Converſion of them to Chriſtianity, thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to bring them to, and to keep them in the Church then. And though you think the caſe is ſo altered ſince the Reformation, as that what was a reaſon of their uſe then, to wit the bringing folk to Church, is a reaſon of their diſ-uſe, and laying aſide now, as tending to the ſame end; yet if this thought hath not hitherto taken place in the minds of the Powers above us, or ſuppoſing they ſhould be under a miſtake in thinking other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, do you think that their prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing undetermined circumſtances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the peace and unity of the Church, which you deem matter of juſt complaint in them, would at all juſtifie you in doing the like? I am ſure it will not, but greatly aggravate your fault. <hi>For wherein thou judgeſt another</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) <hi>thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneſt thy ſelf; for thou that judgeſt, doeſt the ſame things, Rom.</hi> 2.1.</p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:51946:106"/>
               <p>The conſideration of the inequality &amp; diſproportion that is between ſome undetermined circumſtances in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of holy things, and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and peace of the Church; would, as I have reaſon to preſume, have prevailed before now to have obtained ſome eaſe for the ſake of ſuch as are really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly ſcrupulous, but withal peaceable, and as ſcrupulous to diſturb the peace of the Church on the one hand, as they are to diſturb the peace of their own Conſcience on the other; I ſay, this probably would have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ere now, had not your carrying things with ſo high a hand of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, obſtructed it, and hardened their hearts againſt you, in whoſe power it is to eaſe you. And I am very full of confidence, that that very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration I have now mentioned, would yet prevail with them to give you eaſe, if you would but abate your open oppoſition, and comply ſo far as I am confident the greateſt part of you can do, without offending your Conſcience. For if you could but
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51946:106"/>yet be prevailed withal thus to do; who is ſo hard-hearted and ſo regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the unity and peace of the Church, and what depends thereon, as would not in their places and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities ſeek your eaſe? But if you cannot be prevailed withal, I cannot eaſily tell you how much I dread the conſequence of it.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <p>TIme was when it was the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of many of you, that private and perſonal application by you that are Miniſters, to the people of your reſpective Pariſhes, from Houſe to Houſe, was of very great uſe for their profiting in Religion; yea ſo great, that ſome of you have thought you did more good that way, than by your publick miniſtration; and that, in great Pariſhes eſpecially, more Miniſters than one were neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the carrying on of this and the publick work. Yea, you thought this ſo profitable and ſo neceſſary, as that the Miniſters in ſeveral Counties,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:51946:107"/>as of <hi>Worceſter, Eſſex, Cumberland, Weſtmorland, &amp;c.</hi> did enter into a mutual agreement to ingage in this work, and publiſhed the ſame with intent as I ſuppoſe to excite others to do ſo likewiſe. This conſidered, if the promoting of Religion among the people, both in knowledge and practice, was and is your great deſign (and I will not be ſo uncharitable as to judge it neither was nor is) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think I confeſs that you were ſomewhat unhappy, and the Nation too, in that you did not think of and undertake this method of imploying your Talents, rather than that you have choſen, when neceſſity in ſome ſort put you upon it, and wherein you might have been ſo greatly ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and that not only without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending againſt the publick Laws and Peace of the Church, but alſo to your great honour and high accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with good men. And if thoſe who now ſupport you in point of Livelyhood, in the way you are in, would not or will not do the ſame or
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:51946:107"/>more in that other way (not to ſay what might reaſonably be expected from many others who do not like the way you are in) they would give a ſhrewd ground of ſuſpicion, that not the advancement of the power and practice of Religion among us, but ſomewhat elſe prevails with them to do what they do in that kind.</p>
               <p>Undoubtedly the peace and unity of the Church (as I have ſhew'd, and you cannot but know) is a matter of that mighty moment for the increaſe and growth of all <hi>kindly</hi> religiouſneſs in your ſelves and the people, and the contrary ſo certain to produce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effects, that it would be very worthy of you to do what poſſibly you can to ſtop the one, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the other, though it ſhould coſt you ſome conſiderable ſelf-denial to do it. Remember and conſider that excellent advice of <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pa. 69.</note> in his Epiſtle to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> in a time when ſad diviſions and contentions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed among them, as they do now
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51946:108"/>among us. <hi>He therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that is ſtrong, merciful, full of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity among you, let him ſay, If it be for me, that ſedition, contention, and diviſion ariſe, I will depart, I will be gone whither you will: I will do what the people command me; ſo be it that the flock of Chriſt may live in peace with thoſe Presbyters that are ſet over them. He that ſhall do this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will win himſelf much honour in the Lord, and every place will gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him.</hi> Let me ſay to you upon this occaſion, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſaid in his Epiſtle to the ſame Church, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.36. <hi>What? came the word of God to you only, or from you only?</hi> Do you think that Religion in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion depends ſo much upon your pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick labours, as that it would ſink if you did not thereby uphold it? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks you ſhould not, I am ſure there is no reaſon why you ſhould. And if not, then either <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> was out in his forementioned advice, or elſe you ſeem to be ſo in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent practice as differing much from it.</p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:51946:108"/>
               <p>I Will add one thing more before I conclude. I find by ſome of your printed Papers as well as by perſonal diſcourſe, that it runs much in your minds, that if you could but be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged a liberty by the Civil Powers in the ſeparate way in which you now act, it would free you from the imputation of Schiſm; which I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, under your favour, to be a great miſtake, for theſe reaſons. Firſt, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe your practice herein, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſuch an indulgence, would be a deviation from the Primitive pattern of Church Communion. All the Chriſtians then, as I have ſhew'd before, did ſtill aſſociate together in Church Communion, in the places where they did reſide; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the Churches received their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of being the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> at <hi>Corinth, &amp;c.</hi> from the civil bounds. And I have ſhew'd alſo, that ſo to do is moſt accommodate to the ends and purpoſes of Church Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. And for any in theſe
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:51946:109"/>Churches, whiles they did reſide upon the place, to have rent themſelves off from Communion with thoſe, and to have ſet up for themſelves in the ſame place (otherwiſe than what was done with conſent when their numbers made it convenient to meet in diſtinct aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies) or ſhould have gone and have united themſelves with a Church in another place, as diſowning Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with thoſe from whom they went off, when there was no neceſſity of doing ſo, or of ſinning, would have been a down-right Schiſm, and ſeems to have been the very caſe of thoſe St. <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks of, that <hi>ſeparated themſelves, being ſenſual, not having the Spirit, Jude</hi> 19. Now then when there have been Churches of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Profeſſors in this Nation, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by the civil bounds and Precincts, for order and government ſake, in like ſort as they were in the Apoſtles times; for you in this caſe to rend from them, and ſet up other Churches in the ſame places, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Communion with the firſt, by
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:51946:109"/>word or deed, without a neceſſity to do ſo or ſin; though you ſhould not perhaps ſin againſt the Civil Power in doing ſo, in caſe you had their leave, yet this would not free you from Schiſm in making a cauſleſs breach in the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I have ſhewed that a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering out the better people from among thoſe which are not ſo good, and to make a new Church thereof, is croſs to one principal end of Church Conſociation, which is, that the better might help the worſe, and the ſtrong bring forward the weak, the more ſpiritual part help to ſpiritualize the more carnal. The contrary is, as if the grown perſons in a Family ſhould withdraw from the Children, and the healthy from thoſe that are ſick, which every body would cry out of. And if the Higher Powers ſhould connive at ſuch diſorders, the thing would be never the better in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I have ſhew'd what bad effects Schiſm does naturally produce,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51946:110"/>and how contrary it is in it ſelf to the Doctrine of the Apoſtles; and if it be and do ſo, leave from the Civil Powers to perpetrate this evil, would never ſanctifie it, or make it other than it is in its own nature, that is ſinful.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>HAving ſaid thus much as you ſee, I ſhall not need to make any farther Apology why I have done it, than what you have in the beginning of this Addreſs. And as to what it conſiſts of, I ſhall Truſt it to ſpeak for it ſelf (if you will but make that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to the Author, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering his circumſtances, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident ingenuity will not deny him.) Only this I can, and therefore may ſay, that I am not conſcious to my ſelf of having offered any abuſe to the Scriptures by any undue interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or to you by any miſ-applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, nor by any miſ-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of you, in principle or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice:
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:51946:110"/>though I do not think you are all of a piece in both: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that's ſaid is not to be applied to all alike, all being not alike guilty of the Schiſm ſo much complained of in this Addreſs. As my intention in the undertaking of which was the publick good; ſo upon review I cannot perceive that I have ſaid any thing but what is one way or other agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that deſign, nor unbecoming any man of a modeſtly publick ſpirit. And if the removal of a publick grievance out of the Church, and the procuring its publick benefit, hath made the mention and diſcovery of thoſe things neceſſary, the mention and diſcovery of which are likelieſt to offend ſome; yet the neceſſity off that as a means to ſo worthy an end, will I hope plead my excuſe with them, and ſatisfie them upon after thoughts. And if this Addreſs may contribute any thing to the publick good, either while I am alive, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Death, though but in the leaſt degree, (of which I do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together

               <p>Wherefore to conclude: If you would not then have the power and ſpirit of Religion ceaſe from among us, or degenerate into form and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindlineſs of temper: If you would not leave the people in ſuperſtition, into which you ſeem to have led them, nor be guilty of adding to Gods word, by making them believe he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden and commanded, what he hath not forbidden nor commanded, but left to ſuch direction as general rules and emergent circumſtances ſhall ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to prudent men: If you would not vary from the Primitive pattern by ſeparating from the Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations where you reſide, when you are not neceſſitated to it or to ſin: If you would not tempt men to think that Religion is but an uncertain thing and matter of ſquable: If you would not give occaſion of jealouſie, that due regard is wanting in you to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Government: If you would not betray our Poſterity into the
